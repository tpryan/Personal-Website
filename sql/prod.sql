On-Page SEO means more now than ever since the new Google update: Panda. No longer are backlinks and simply pinging or sending out a RSS feed the key to getting Google PageRank or Alexa Rankings, You now NEED On-Page SEO. So what is good On-Page SEO?First your keyword must appear in the title.Then it must appear in the URL.You have to optimize your keyword and make sure that it has a nice keyword density of 3-5% in your article with relevant LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing). Then you should spread all H1,H2,H3 tags in your article.Your Keyword should appear in your first paragraph and in the last sentence of the page. You should have relevant usage of Bold and italics of your keyword.There should be one internal link to a page on your blog and you should have one image with an alt tag that has your keyword....wait there\'s even more Now what if i told you there was a simple Wordpress plugin that does all the On-Page SEO, and automatically for you? That\'s right AUTOMATICALLY, just watch this 4minute video for more information at. <a href=\"http://www.SEORankingLinks.com\">Seo Plugin</a>\";s:12:\"comment_type\";s:0:\"\";s:7:\"user_ip\";s:13:\"107.172.6.107\";s:10:\"user_agent\";s:61:\"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Trident/7.0; rv:11.0) like Gecko\";s:4:\"blog\";s:28:\"http://terrenceryan.com/blog\";s:9:\"blog_lang\";s:5:\"en_US\";s:12:\"blog_charset\";s:5:\"UTF-8\";s:9:\"permalink\";s:82:\"http://terrenceryan.com/blog/index.php/compiling-flex-hero-apps-with-mxmlc-in-ant/\";}'),(40185,14815,'akismet_result','true'),(40186,14815,'akismet_history','a:2:{s:4:\"time\";d:1467427777.5757201;s:5:\"event\";s:10:\"check-spam\";}'),(40187,14815,'akismet_as_submitted','a:13:{s:14:\"comment_author\";s:10:\"asSns1eavk\";s:20:\"comment_author_email\";s:23:\"cyrstal@mails4mails.bid\";s:18:\"comment_author_url\";s:26:\"http://buy-tadalafil.party\";s:15:\"comment_content\";s:212:\"<a href=http://buycytotec.party/>cytotec</a> <a href=http://atarax.site/>atarax</a> <a href=http://abilify.in.net/>abilify</a> <a href=http://buy-nolvadex.trade/>buy nolvadex</a> <a href=http://vpxl.xyz/>vpxl</a>\";s:12:\"comment_type\";s:0:\"\";s:7:\"user_ID\";i:0;s:7:\"user_id\";i:0;s:7:\"user_ip\";s:11:\"46.161.9.20\";s:10:\"user_agent\";s:109:\"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/48.0.2564.109 Safari/537.36\";s:4:\"blog\";s:42:\"http://arctic-marking-865.appspot.com/blog\";s:9:\"blog_lang\";s:5:\"en_US\";s:12:\"blog_charset\";s:5:\"UTF-8\";s:9:\"permalink\";s:76:\"http://arctic-marking-865.appspot.com/blog/index.php/links-for-aiga-raleigh/\";}'),(40188,14816,'akismet_result','true'),(40189,14816,'akismet_history','a:2:{s:4:\"time\";d:1467432003.8262711;s:5:\"event\";s:10:\"check-spam\";}'),(40190,14816,'akismet_as_submitted','a:11:{s:14:\"comment_author\";s:13:\"Jocelyn Ahalt\";s:20:\"comment_author_email\";s:22:\"Kohnert64715@yahoo.com\";s:18:\"comment_author_url\";s:75:\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Head-Soccer-Cheats-And-Hack/1401095683509651\";s:15:\"comment_content\";s:212:\"Hello, Neat post.

On-Page SEO means more now than ever since the new Google update: Panda. No longer are backlinks and simply pinging or sending out a RSS feed the key to getting Google PageRank or Alexa Rankings, You now NEED On-Page SEO. So what is good On-Page SEO?First your keyword must appear in the title.Then it must appear in the URL.You have to optimize your keyword and make sure that it has a nice keyword density of 3-5% in your article with relevant LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing). Then you should spread all H1,H2,H3 tags in your article.Your Keyword should appear in your first paragraph and in the last sentence of the page. You should have relevant usage of Bold and italics of your keyword.There should be one internal link to a page on your blog and you should have one image with an alt tag that has your keyword....wait there\'s even more Now what if i told you there was a simple Wordpress plugin that does all the On-Page SEO, and automatically for you? That\'s right AUTOMATICALLY, just watch this 4minute video for more information at. <a href=\"http://www.SEORankingLinks.com\">Seo Plugin</a>\";s:12:\"comment_type\";s:0:\"\";s:7:\"user_ip\";s:13:\"107.172.6.107\";s:10:\"user_agent\";s:61:\"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Trident/7.0; rv:11.0) like

I ran your tests on my Mac and, in \"development\" mode, I saw the in-memory CFC invocation be anything from 10-50% faster on repeated runs. In \"production\" mode (i.e., with trusted cache enabled), the times were much closer between in-memory CFC invocation and custom tags. My in-memory CFC invocation tests typically ran in around 70 (prod) to 100ms (dev). My custom tag invocation tests typically ran in around 70 (dev) to 200ms (dev). Therefore I\'m suspicious of your custom tag timings on your systems since your production system is an order of magnitude slower than my laptop (whereas the in-memory CFC invocation is in the same ballpark).\n\nFWIW, the direct CFC invocation was way slower on my system than on yours, both with and without trusted cache.\n\nDefinitely an interesting observation tho\'!\n\nMy main argument for not using CFCs for output (and preferring either custom tags or simple CFML pages) is that you can\'t really have a graphic designer / web production person editing your CFCs, whereas they can easily edit custom tags and CFML pages in their regular WYSIWYG HTML editor.

Cfincluding a template will encapsulate it, but you can\'t pass in variables. (However you can set them before you call the included file.) For example, let say I had an encapsulated navigation bar, and I wanted it to behave differently on different pages. With cfinclude, I would have to set a variable somewhere before I called the included code to indicate which page it was on, or use the cgi.scope to determine it.

You can create jobs with SQL server (I don\'t know what the equivalent is in other databases) to do this. Not only is it supported nativly inside SQL Server, it\'s much much faster than anything CF can do.\n\nWhy would you use CF to send out thousands of emails through a gateway? Again, this is another task that could easily be offloaded to mass email program running on a different server.\n\nIt goes with that old saying that just because you can do something, doesn\'t mean you should.

This isn\'t a replacement for human code reviews, but it can be a nice way to  complement them.\n\nFor ColdFusion, there\'s a tool called CodeCop by Steve Bryant that\'s worth a look.  It lets you create rules which the engine will apply against your code.

That may be true - but your solution may still take longer and produce something better than \"good enough,\" in which case, you\'ve still wasted your time.\n\nTo me, Joel\'s article read more about not outsourcing your primary business function - not your primary talent.  So for instance, if you were selling data mining services, you might want to write your own applications for it.  But, if you can make use of Reactor (which, you may or may not be able to do), then you still might do that.  But, if you were selling ORM frameworks, you might not want to use Reactor to do it.

The MonitoringServletFilter is the \"perimeter\" of the monitoring system - when exceptions are thrown from within CF, they\'re caught there, logged by monitoring, and rethrown. I would suggest you trace down the logs some more, and you\'ll probably find an entry beneath the one for this exception indicating the root cause exception. And do keep in mind that OutOfMemoryErrors occur when, well, the JVM is out of memory - is there any possibility that your application is creating objects, and not throwing them away, eating all the JVM memory?

It\'s always seemed to me that these shouldn\'t require major rewriting of things, but when I have raised these issues with folks at Adobe, the response has always been \"do you want us fixing things like this, or adding new features?\" We need to get the message out that yes, we want these fixed!\nAnd Justin - I would argue that adding XHTML support would not in any way mess up HTML 4.01 pages, since technically, XHTML is valid HTML (but not the other way around), and potentially having to support a theoretical future version of HTML isn\'t a valid reason to not support a current version of XHTML. However, if that is a real issue, then maybe we need to have something like a cfdoctype element that lets us control these types of things.

How can you bring anything meaningful (seriously) to the topic without an opinion? Oh, your holding back! Post what happens after MAX if you will. (please)\n\nI can tell you that one of the reasons people use CF is as you said. It is easier. Yet what are the reasons people use other tools. Many of the MS tools are about seperating processing from markup. In fact there are some new Flex/Air tools being presented at MAX with the same goal in mind. That is alos what I am doing with COOP. This is an open source project that goes to RC1 next week. It provides (but doesn\'t demand) seperation of markup from processing.\n\nWhat is my point. The power of ColdFusion is a mix of CFCs and Custom Tags... in addition to the easy stuff. In fact in general CF is so easy that many developers have been to lazy to innovate and make it easier still. Ruby isn\'t \"easy\"... but RoR improved the picture. dotNet isn\'t easy... but the IDE improved the picture for startup users. (Note: The deeper you go the more challenging it becomes. It should be the deeper you get the easier it becomes.)

Oracle has gone a long way to be more user friendly since the 9i and 10g releases.\n\nOracle now support the standard outer join syntax and case statements (even tho oracle\'s decode is nicer) which makes migration easy.\n\nThere is the XE version which is free for up to 4Gb of data. Beyond that, the major difference between the two is sequences, which is how oracle handles auto-increment pk\'s.\n\nSequences are a lot cleaner and more flexible from my experience.

These problems did not happen overnight. So why are we in such a rush to fix them in 24 hours. Take the damn time to find the best solution. Yes, I believe that the government should act expeditously. We certainly don\'t want Congress to drag this process out like it does every decision that is placed on the table. But, when we are talking about this much money, which will mammoth the deficit even further, we need to think about the best interest of the people. All people. Not just the rich and these mega corporations! Not just whites, but minorities too.\n\nI am not one to point the finger, but the system that we have been operating under for so many years, is flawed. In my estimation, the root of the problemis racism and classism,designed to separate people into these categories. Why else do you think it is possible for a white person who makes the same income, and whom has the same credit rating as his black counterpart, to get approval for loans that would be denied to his black counterpart. That is why we have so many foreclosures in the vanilla suburbs, because the whites don\'t want to live next door to blacks or other minorities. So, they moved out to the burbs, and we aided by the government and business infrastructure including the banks, who enabled them to do so. They in essence have enabled these old cancers to survive by approving white people for loans that they otherwise would not be eligible for. Thus ensuring de facto segreagtion.\n\nSadly, it is nothing new, but simply more of the racism this country was built upon. To remedy this situation, (yeah right, it hasn\'t happened in 400 years) Americans need to unite, and hold our lawmakers accountable. White, black, red, brown, and yellow, will all suffer because of the green. China and the Middle Eastern countries already own substantial pieces of America in the form of loans, banks,  and companies. If this money were to be called due today, my God.

For the record I am using Eclipse Helios SR2 with Subversive 0.7.9.I20110207-1700. Sure the advice about not moving folders is sound, but this is adapting user behavior to buggy code, ugh.  At the very least Subversive could put up a gosh-darned dialog to say \"Hey buddy this operation will break your workspace do you really want to continue\"?

Nonetheless, its far easier said than done. First of all, getting a Ruby person (to continue your example) to respond to a ColdFusion position opening or even want to necessarily accept said position once they learn it is mostly CF is difficult. Second, having been in on a lot of searches, I think we forget that 90% of developers don\'t study regularly, read blogs, subscribe to journals (I made that number up...but I\'d be willing to bet its not far from true). I would bet that goes for almost any language. To me what makes a good developer great is a curiosity that is lacking in many CF developers (if not in developers in general).\n\nI would argue that some other languages offer more opportunities for continued learning than CF and few places teach it. It\'s even hard to find anyplace running the training regularly in a lot of places. The lousy job market seems to have put a lot of talented people on the market and if you are lucky to have the ability to hire right now, you might find it not so difficult to find great talent at lower rates...but I doubt it is easy still.',0,'1','','',0,0),(749,251,'Andy Sandefer','asandefer@teammis.com','http://www.teammis.com','','2009-01-27 13:52:13','2009-01-27 13:52:13','I think that this is just a symptom of a larger disease, a disease that is actually being treated and getting better - lack of mainstream CF market penetration.

For one thing they\'re going after new blood by hiring folks like you to hit colleges and universities to get CF and FLEX out there.\nCleaning up the whole certification process and eradicating some of the misinformation that\'s out there will help too.\nWhat is the CF market share and what is the direction for making it grow?

I am sure any web designer can learn any other language in a short time but its kinda hard to say that any developer will be coding like a pro in months of learning CF. 3+ years and I am still learning new things. I think its only fair to say the learning curve is shorter than perhaps ASP .NET etc but there is much more deeper under that JAVA hood that most companies will need a developer to get to grips with, some concepts that only take practical experience to become proficient.\n\nno another note: JAVA and .NET developers seem to take to CF more easily than PHP, I dont know why thats just been my own experience at work.',0,'1','','',0,0),(751,251,'Steven Erat','talkingtree@gmail.com','http://www.talkingtree.com/blog/about.cfm','','2009-01-27 14:37:16','2009-01-27 14:37:16','I can barely contain myself at the sight of this post, but I\'ll try to stay focused.\n\nAs a long timer with ColdFusion as developer / tech supp / QA for Adobe itself and now looking for employment, I can testify that its a cold out there.

In a better economy I would imagine that related skill silos would be viewed as easily transferable, but now the prevailing opinion seems to be that they won\'t choose someone who can &quot;grow into it&quot;. In my experience employers want to see that you have done *precisely* the task they are looking to hire.\n\nI\'m fortunate to have had some friends reach out to me, but I haven\'t found a match for my own criteria, but with every week that passes I throw another criterion out.\n\nNow compare today with the dotcom bubble.

This comes up a lot where you have one master record related to several records in another table in a one to many relationship. cfquery or cfloop makes it very very easy to output without repeating data common to multiple rows and therefore gives you a lot of control over the presentation of your data. Faced with a similar situation in PHP, I searched high and low to find out how to do it and was told basically that you can\'t. (You can but it is quite complicated). The &quot;easy&quot; PHP solution was to query one table, loop over it to output the row AND query the other table to get rows matching the current row from the first table and output that in a nested loop(ie, another query for each row in the first query. The result is dozens or even hundreds(or more) database hits instead of just oned needed by CF.\nYou can even group on parts of field data such as date parts. I once took a year\'s worth of data and was able to create nice neat presentation of it by grouping on the Year, then the Month, then the Week, then created links of each item and then (getting carried away a bit) put the components of each item in a tool tip.

I agree with another commenter, that just comparing the number of lines of code is not the correct way to compare languages.  If that were the case ColdFusion would be the best by a mile (as you can do so much with so little code).  Becoming a seasoned developer means you can objectively look into the requirements of a project and then determine the best language or platform to meet those needs and goals.  As much as I love ColdFusion, it is not the best choice for every situation.  There are others that it meets perfectly.

The key at this point is to fix the problem and prevent this from happening again. That is the light I\'m taking in my following questions.\n\n\n&quot;Is it true that Adobe had a fix for months and sat on it?&quot; Your time line says essentially 8 weeks ago from this week (so about 2 months). Bare in mind the hotfix still isn\'t out yet so the clock is still running. So 8 weeks ago, was that the official post/request for the hotfix or the initial contact?\n\n\n\n&quot;The customer was not satisfied with just a workaround for several reasons including concern that we were not actually fixing the correct problem. (This concern ended up being true.)&quot; Sounds like confusion on the Adobe end of this. That naturally makes me even more concerned about the internal process at Adobe. Yes, there should be a procedure, but once a security vulnerability of this level has been detected, the black hats typically already know. Perhaps I\'m missing something, but I simply can\'t think of any reason why it should have taken this long given the nature of the vulnerability.\n\n\n\n&quot;Additionally, our security people were also not entirely convinced that the workaround was entirely the right solution.&quot; Why? It really is a simple solution. What other options did they really have?\n\n\n\nOn the flip side of this, did management not understand the nature of the problem? What was their reaction to this initially? It\'s on them to understand the gravity of this and to act. I suspect from this post that some of this is being dump on the security team when management really has to take full responsibility.\n\n\n\nThe other part of this is why the vulnerability was allowed to live on in the CF 8.0.1 trials / downloads from Adobe. Some people had fairly new instances being created in the meantime that didn\'t need to have this bug open. Basically, you could have limited the fire by doing that.',0,'1','','',0,0),(862,295,'John Mason','mason@fusionlink.com','http://www.codfusion.com','','2009-07-06 21:54:00','2009-07-06 21:54:00','The current PSIRT posts still says \'potential\' security issue (http://blogs.adobe.com/psirt/2009/07/potential_coldfusion_security.html).

I begged for better caching. So take this as a minor nit.\n\ndependsOn is really more of a key. A unique key that determines if the cache has changed.\n\nTo me, when I first read dependsOn, I thought it was creating some kind of \'live connection\'. So to use your example, I wouldn\'t have to reload the page. CF would &quot;know&quot; when the value changes and clear the cache for me.\n\nObviously that isn\'t the case. If you never visit this page again, it will persist as long as the application scope does. I also tended to think of dependsOn as a CACHE dependency. Ie, cache item C is bound to cache item P. If cache item P changes, or times out, it should kill the C cache.

This is a huge feature and perhaps unappreciated.\n\nThe end result is the ability to scale and generate pages faster with less servers.  And with the move to the cloud, DB hits generally becomes a much more expensive operation.  Being able to persist data into the cache with sub-millisecond retrieval is great.\n\nAll that can be cached should be cached.  Both static page fragments and user customized fragments.  Facebook has a limited number of PHP application servers but a lot of memcached instances.  The same principles apply to CF/ehcache.\n\nWill the cache survive and be reference-able across CF restarts?  Looks like no, but I hope I am wrong.  Can Ehcache still manage it\'s own distributed cache?  What version of Ehcache is the beta using?  What version do you expect the release to use?  Will it be possible to update Ehcache independent of CF?\n\nAs a general point it would be great to know if any of the baked in components will be able to be updated independently (ExtJS, Hibernate, Ehcache, Solr)  Waiting 2 years (between CF releases) for an update of sub components is too long.

My point is everyone wins with updates.  The hot fix approach is a smart way to let users opt in as wanted.\n\nUpdates are valuable to those that don\'t know about baked-in components.  They can get additional performance benefits with little to no effort.  Example Adobe hotfix releasing an updated version of ehcache.  Who doesn\'t want faster loading pages?\n\nThen for those that are in the know, there is huge value add in Adobe doing the heavily lifting of doing the integration testing.  Once the hotfix is out, I just have to do a quick test with my app to make sure all is good.  If I was working with a stand alone version, the workload could be much greater if some of the underlying APIs had changed.\n\nI think the benefits of frequent Ext updates are obvious to even a enthusiast developer.  Beside improved features, there could be underlying speed and compatibility fixes.  Who wouldn\'t want that for the few minutes of time to instal a hot fix using the new admin tool?\n\nTo me this is the benefit of going with a commercial product.  The open source web app development platforms don\'t stand still.  Look at Railo, PHP or RoR.

With HTML you add in a CSS file to style, and I believe there is similar type of document that combines with the DDX to create your fully stylized PDF.\n\nThats obviously a lot more work to dig into and I only had the time to do the thumbnail solution for now, but hope that helps.\n\n@Terrence thanks for the blog and great tips that even got me started on solving my use case.',0,'1','','',0,0),(952,314,'Ed','edcheng33@hotmail.com','','','2010-10-18 17:14:07','2010-10-18 17:14:07','Yes you need OpenOffice installed, then add the directory in the admin settings under \'Documents\' section.

It seems we can only use the license key on as many dev/test/staging servers as we have purchased production keys:\n\n\"the total number of Computers used to operate the Development Software [can] not exceed the licensed number of Servers\"\n\nNow, that\'s not a real tragedy. The offer to do even one per license is a certainly a step up for many. But people should be aware of this issue. Can you confirm that I\'m reading this right, Terry?\n\nAlso, in case folks wondered if there was any difference between where the prod server was installed and where these dev/test/staging servers could be installed, it seems that the dev/test/staging server must be on the same network as the licensed servers, as it says we can only \"install the Development Software on Servers connected to Licensee’s Internal Network\".\n\nOf course, \"connected to licensee\'s internal network\" is rather vague (and to be clear, IANAL: I am not a lawyer.) I can see some wanting to have the prod server license on a managed host box while the test/staging use would be done on a server internal to the company. That would not seem supported.\n\nBefore we conclude that I\'m reading things right, though, some may be surprised to see the same paragraph indicating that we cannot \"(ii) access the Development Software from more than a single IP address at any given time\". I can understand that for the free Dev edition but that would seem counter to a dev/test/staging server where production load may be replicated for testing purposes, and that may come from a scattered set of servers sending the load, or just scattered testers running at once.\n\nI\'m wondering if perhaps these last two points really apply just to the free developer edition (though even that is not technically limited to just one IP address). I think the problem is that someone tried to cover both the free Dev edition and these \"Production Software licenses...[used] as Development Software\" in the singel section 3.2.\n\nCan you get clarification on these things, Terry?\n\nI do hope these questions and their answers only help people. I was torn, as surely some would say \"well why not let it be vague? why press for an answer, because if Adobe answers it takes away any wiggle room?\". But there are people whose companies really want to do things by the book, and this news is compelling.\n\nIt would just be unfortunate if they were left with a misinterpretation based on attempts here to keep things concise. Certainly, it\'s great that Terry has pointed it out, and those who want to play fast and loose can just deny they ever saw this clarification. :-) But I think your lawyers (or higher ups you report to) will want these clarifications. More than that, perhaps the wording of that section 3.2 might be reconsidered to split out the two \"Dev\" uses, if they really are different.

I\'ll admit I may *have* been a little confused in my question of where the dev/staging license was allowed. It wasn\'t that I wondered if the \"owner of the server\" was the licensee, but rather I was just thinking that where the production license was installed might become the \"internal network\" in this verbiage. I see now that I missed the term being defined in the EULA definitions section. That point is now clear. Still, I hope that drawing out the point about how this test/staging server must be on the \"internal network\" may help someone.\n\n@Terry, as for your reply about VPN access, I see now that that too is covered in the definition section for \"internal network\". I hadn\'t asked about it, but I sense that you\'re offering it in response to my question about what IP addresses can access this dev/test/staging server. While the definition section does say that\'s allowed, it still doesn\'t address the point I made about a later section that seems to counter it.\n\nLet me repeat and condense that, as well as the first question I raised in my last comment:\n\n- do I have it correct that this clause, \"(ii) access the Development Software from more than a single IP address at any given time\", does apply to this dev/test/staging servers using the production license key? It would seem it should not, and should apply only to the free Dev edition (in which case it\'s still more than just \"a single\" IP address it allows), but that\'s not the way it\'s worded if you read the section. This seems an important point.\n\n- do I have it correct that a single purchase of a production license allows only a single use of that license on one other server for dev or test or staging? So that if one wants, say, test and staging, they will still need to buy another license for the 2nd of those two?\n\nIs it appropriate for us to seek answers to these here?

Often one uses a datasource that may point to a development database (ac=accounting_dev), and then when ready change the CF datasource to point it to the \"working\" database (ac=accounting).  Using the workaround one would need to go in and do a global search and replace on every component prior to putting them into production. Not good.\n\nActually, this also fails for a couple of other reasons. First, as you mention, a datasource specs a server, a port, user credentials, and so on.\n\nSo what if the other database required different credentials for access? A relatively common occurrence, is it not?\n\nSecond, and worse, what if the required database is on an entirely different server? As mentioned earlier, a client I work for has a member database, a content database, and a database used for logging sessions and page requests. All are hit for each page request, and for performance reasons the logging database is in fact on a separate server.\n\nIn which case, saying Members.users and Logging.pages doesn\'t work, as each is on a different server and as such requires it\'s own connection.\n\nJust how hard would it have been to allow this?\n\ncomponent persistent=\"true\" table=\"artists\" datasource=\"workgroup\"\n{\n}\n\nYou could easily have spawned a distinct handler for each datasource named and referenced during a given request.\n\nAs I said before, I was really looking forward to using the new ORM features in CF9. Unfortunately, it seems that it\'s been hobbled to the point where one would need two distinct ORM solutions in one\'s toolbox. The CF9 version for relatively simple environments and circumstances, and something more robust to cover everything else.\n\nI\'d say that I\'d be looking forward to this being corrected in CF X, but given Adobe\'s past history in such matters, it\'s entirely likely that they\'d regard \"complex\" environments as being Enterprise-only...',0,'1','','',0,0),(1066,336,'Charlie Arehart','charlie@carehart.org','http://www.carehart.org','','2009-10-12 23:26:37','2009-10-12 23:26:37','Subscribing.',0,'1','','',0,0),(1067,336,'Marcel','bird0fprey@hotmail.com','','','2009-10-14 20:15:12','2009-10-14 20:15:12','Mark Mandel was saying that this is mostly due to the inner workings of Hibernate and made sense if you understood Hibernate, I don\'t, so feel free to explain further :)',0,'1','','',0,0),(1068,336,'Marvin','marvin@vvelzen.com','','','2009-11-16 05:46:42','2009-11-16 05:46:42','I was wondering if you actually got this working, or that this is just in theory.\n\nAs I have tried it myself, but did not get it too work.',0,'1','','',0,0),(1069,336,'AJ Michels','ajmichels.web@gmail.com','http://ajmichels.com','','2010-06-23 11:21:20','2010-06-23 11:21:20','In case anyone was having issues getting Terry\'s \'work-around\' to work you need to have the following define for each Entity that is pointed at a different Database.

If you want to allow active regeneration of CFC\'s, just passively generate subclasses that people can edit and make them extend superclasses that you re-generate every time. It\'s the easiest solution to the problem, and the most commonly used.\n\nActive regeneration of layouts is hard, and in the general case probably impossible. There isn\'t a strict enough semantic in the generated HTML to be able to do much in the way of intelligent round trip engineering (you can figure out bits and pieces, but not everything). If you were doing it just for yourself, you could come up with a set of constraints you were willing to live with and a specific architecture that would allow for regeneration of as much of the views as possible. In the general case, easiest solution is to move as much of the view functionality (paging links, field displays, validation code, etc) implemented through view helper CFC\'s. That way again you can passively gen subclasses for the view helpers should someone want to override the implementation of a method and then actively regenerate the parent view helper classes. Make sure you do things like expose all the metadata through an API, so if you have a fixed number of records per page in your XML, have a getRecordsPerPage() method in the paging.cfc view helper. That way if someone does decide to overload your paging display because they want to change how it works, they can still reuse the XML metadata.',0,'1','','',0,0),(1114,347,'tpryan','terry@terrenceryan.com','http://www.terrenceryan.com/blog/','','2009-12-14 12:29:52','2009-12-14 12:29:52','@peter.

Installing a Flash blocker radically improves the browsing experience; it\'s one of two reasons why Chrome remains a secondary browser here.\n\nBack in the early 2000s, Steve Wozniak posted a comment on a mailing list to the effect that most Classic Mac crashes which were attributed to the operating system were actually due to Microsoft system extensions. It occurred to me for the first time: my System 8 and 9 servers routinely had months of uptime, but I told my clients that it was normal for a Mac to freeze every couple of days.\n\nRetroactive reason: with Classic Mac OS, the first thing you installed was Microsoft Office. We didn\'t have good alternatives back then. So even folks like me, who knew Mac OS backwards and forwards, obscured something that should have been obvious.\n\nLikewise: Apple\'s goal in producing the iPhone and creating a closed ecosystem was creating a phone that didn\'t crash. By and large, they succeeded. If Flash plug-ins brought down the iPhone regularly, it wouldn\'t be attributed to Flash, it would be attributed to the iPhone... just as we unfairly maligned Classic Mac OS.\n\nGoing forward?

You\'ll have good company: <http://www.google.com/mobile/voice/>.\n\nPerhaps you\'ve forgotten 2007, when Apple encouraged web app development as the *only* way of doing business.\n\nIt\'s widely believed that Apple runs the iTunes and iApp stores at close to breakeven; they exist to sell hardware, which is where Apple makes its profit margin. This is almost certainly true of apps, where many are sold at $0.99, and Apple has a high overhead cost in product approval and QA.\n\nIf you want to follow the money, I\'ll oblige you: Apple believes that putting Flash in Mobile Safari will weaken the experience (with system instability and slow CPU response), and lessen the gap between their hardware and their competitors. *That\'s* a bottom line issue.

Apple is particularly exclusive, and I for one don\'t see that changing any time soon. If you have to pick a club, there is an argument to be made for the one that already has the most members (Flash). There\'s also an argument to be made for the openness of HTML5, but until it\'s broadly supported it can\'t be your only investment if you want to reach a wide audience.\n\nI can\'t say that lack of Flash on the iPhone has me frothing at the mouth for a Google Nexus One; but it *does* have me keeping an eye on the Android platform, waiting for the \"magical\" (to borrow the term) day when my AT&T contract is up, and hoping that the Nexus One matures in the meantime. (Seriously: WTF is up with the scroll ball?!)\n\nAnyway, I think HTML5 is well intentioned but specifically in the case of video (and the ongoing codec war), it\'s just another example of why design by committee is doomed to failure.

IMHO, Apple should get over itself and let its users play their flash games if they want to.\n\n2)  I\'m not sure why anyone would argue about how much money Apple makes from their app store, when they are legally bound to tell us in their <a HREF=\"http://yahoo.brand.edgar-online.com/displayfilinginfo.aspx?FilingID=7001513-133204-201186&type=sect&dcn=0001193125-10-012085\" rel=\"nofollow\">10Q reports</A>.  If you look at \"Net Sales by Product,\" you\'ll see that for the three months ending 12/26/09, ITMS sales accounted for $1.2B of the $15.7B Apple made in Net Sales, or roughly 7.6%.

Common sense says the latter, but certainly the App store is designed along the same lines as the music store.\n\nIn any case, presuming that a large chunk of the $1.2 billion from the music store is profit, there\'s still a 3-1 sales ratio between iPods and ITMS.

Let me tell you, I don\'t think Adobe could have made the path more hard.\n\nI can\'t tell you how much of a nightmare it was for me to go from an expired trial version of CFBuilder 1.0 to the update 1. I won\'t even begin to explain the hours I spent trying to make it happen on my MacBook Pro and Mac OSX 10.6.x.  I don\'t know why Adobe hasn\'t updated the free trial download yet... this update came out in May and it\'s now nearly Nov and it\'s still 1.0.0? When I tried to update it the Help > update menu pick was grayed out. I had to hunt and hunt how to fix that problem finding a corrupted something in /Library/...Preferences which kept returning. When it did allow me to access that menu item all it would do is update Adobe CS4 stuff. THat\'s it! No CFBuilder update. I had multiple other things go wrong. I searched and searched for anyone with a solution and found lots of others with the same problem. FInally I found a link to the update itself as a stand along download. I got it and tried to run it.  It was a ~80MB download so I figured it was all there. But the update run got part way and appeared to hang. I kept giving up after about 5 minutes as the progress bar was stuck. I happened to notice on about the 3 or 4th try that while \"stuck\" my iStat menu bar app for showing internet traffic showed my Mac was downloading. What?  Yes indeed it was downloading more app?  WTF? I went to bed and when I returned in the morning sure enough it had completed.  WHy why why Terrence...does Adobe make using CFBuilder SO DAMN\'D Hard for us to switch to?  Geez!!!\n\nI\'ve been trying to come up to speed on using CFB and that is another nightmare initself.  Trying to figure out how to set up SVN, a remote server AND a localhost server for local testing is described NOWHERE (I\'m talking the whole combo, not pieces.)  I want to know what is a recommended workflow to follow for starting a new project through to pushing files to a remote server and to checkin back to SVN repository and find NOT ONE SOURCE of such a flow suggestion. I spent about 8 hrs working on setup and config of CFBuilder and it\'s still not clear I got it right!  I tried once before when my Trial version was still in play and gave up and went back to DW again because it was too hard to figure out how to get it all put together like I had in DW.\n\nWHY WHY WHY does Adobe make it so hard!! Geez!!!\n\nPLEASE get this info back to your developers to have them make the setup more intuitive. And get this to Adobe management and tell them to get some documentation teams on the case to make more tutorials, videos and articles on getting going with CFBuilder. Yes I found a few but they were scant or went through teh forms, filling them out.  I found changes between the old docs about beta setup and released version that confused the situation worse. For example, when setting up a Localhost server to I specify it as a JRun or Other in the dropdown menu?

There is no doubt in my mind that the total cost of ownership (TCO) for ColdFusion applications is substantially less than most of not all other languages; the issue is that most developers do not care at all about that aspect. This is an issue because most of the criticism about ColdFusion comes from developers.  Those who do assess TCO are the business managers and that is why, 15 years on, companies still buy ColdFusion and yes it is not free and yes it was not killed off by Microsoft, as was Netscape and many others. The reason, because it is a great language/framework or whatever term is used to describe it. My second point and another criticism often leveled at ColdFusion is that it does not scale, that is absolute and arrant nonsense and I speak from authority, having spent the past 11 years of my working life designing, engineering and deploying large ColdFusion applications around the world.  On the weekend of the Indy500, 4 ColdFusion servers handled a peak traffic load of 48,500 concurrent users and did not \"bat an eyelid\" and I am not exaggerating, that is 48,500 concurrent users, I just want to repeat that.

Shared hosting is often not a good option for *any* tech that requires top performance, and the time spent chasing down problems which result from shared hosting could usually be saved by paying a bit more for a dedicated box up front.\n\nCF *is* a rather expensive proposition up front, but in the right hands, it can certainly be a lower TCO and allow people to be more productive.  Problem is, you have to want to learn how to exploit it in the first place.  Being a crap PHP or Ruby or Python dev has a lower barrier to entry (low up front cost and such) than does being a crap CF developer.  Basically, if you plan to use CF, I think you owe it to your bottom line to get the most out of the license that you\'re paying for (ditto with a .net stack too).\n\n\"Competent, well-written CF apps that implement proper caching techniques, take advantage of CF\'s shared memory, and use just plain old common sense (uhhh, yeah...let\'s not run 20 SQL queries on the homepage) perform perfectly fine.\"  This could - and probably *should* - be rewritten as\n\n\"Competent, well-written *web* apps that implement proper caching techniques, take advantage of a platform\'s optimizations, and use just plain old common sense (uhhh, yeah...let\'s not run 20 SQL queries on the homepage) perform perfectly fine.\"\n\nI\'m tired of hearing PHP doesn\'t scale, Ruby doesn\'t scale, Java doesn\'t scale, ASP.NET doesn\'t scale.

Your not seeing a whole lot of fun start ups building exciting applications on top of CF, and those are typically the most fun to do jobs for.\n\nWhen I do find shops involved in active CF development, they always seem to be large organizations with large political games going on, and the IT director knows nothing about development, but yet he is the one calling the development shots... so that that kinda sucks.\n\nI am young in my development career, and I grasped a hold of CF early on and enjoy it most of the time.

MS realized this, and is fighting the \'free\' stacks with programs like websitespark.com which offer free licenses to small shops and startups for up to 3 years, with reduced pricing afterwards.  Free LAMP and Rails stacks and the like are hard to compete against.  These platforms have commoditized the marketplace.\n\nTo break out of a commodity status, you differentiate.  What is CF\'s differentiating factors?  Beyond \"faster development\" (which, frankly, most platforms tout/promise anyway), the big diffs (imo) are MS/Office integration, PDF integration, etc.  The same features that differentiate CF from other stacks also appeal to (and have value to) larger MS-oriented organizations.\n\nI\'d love to see more CF out there - I think it\'s got some unique things to offer (tight flash integration, for one), but it\'s not enough to pull me away from Grails or PHP for any projects right now.  Unless someone already had CF skills on board, it\'d be hard for me to recommend someone building something in CF - unless there was a specific use case to spoke to the MS/Office integration, PDF integration, etc.  And those projects would likely be at the larger, boring \'enterprise\' type places.\n\nI don\'t think it\'s \'no win\' for CF, but it\'s at risk of being marginalized in to specific niches (like asp.net may be marginalized in to primarily in-house and intranet projects).',0,'1','','',0,0),(1240,388,'Mike Henke','henke.mike@gmail.com','http://www.henke.ws','','2010-06-17 15:11:50','2010-06-17 15:11:50','Don\'t forget ColdFusion projects on Github :-)\n\nhttp://github.com/languages/ColdFusion',0,'1','','',0,0),(1241,388,'tpryan','terry@terrenceryan.com','http://www.terrenceryan.com/blog/','','2010-06-17 15:18:11','2010-06-17 15:18:11','Sorry, Mike, I dug around, looking for it, and couldn\'t find the link.

I work for a mid-sized agency who have been working with ColdFusion for many, many years now. When I joined 5 years ago we were an ASP/CF house. We\'re now CF, .NET, PHP, but we still use CF for a large proportion of our projects. Are these projects boring, or political? No.\n\nWe\'ve got a project in development at the moment that is doing something with audio that hasn\'t been done before, and it\'s built using CF. That\'s a start up, by the way. We\'ve worked with another successful startup in the last year to build them a networking site with some really nice touches, which is doing very well. We\'ve currently got a cool little data absorption and analysis tool being made VERY rapidly using cfspreadsheet, and we\'ve got any number of other innovative little sites going on that use features of CF that other languages just wouldn\'t give us. It\'s not all about the little projects either - we work with some very big names, and a hell of a lot of them are using CF.\n\nIf you want your career to stay away from boring jobs or annoying political ones my advice would be to choose better workplaces, not blame the platform.

Industries I\'ve hit thoroughly along the way: Sports / Media (including one superbowl team website for scalability :-)), background information, xmpp chat integration, mobile application integration, asset management in every way and much more. All in ColdFusion, with some being completely new applications, some having been around for a while and others a bit dated while still being very innovative.\n\nBy no means have I escaped dealing with dated code or badly written code at any point, but hey, if I walked into a job and everything was done perfect they likely wouldn\'t need me for much other than adding a couple features. Sometimes a scenario resembling that happens, but I prefer jobs where I can innovate with the client and have some room for me to show them how valuable we can be long term as well. In particular, startups are often looking for assistance in choosing the toolsets they work with or they have a tech person they trust to help them with that already, so often its about finding the ones that are interested in what you have to say.\n\nMy suggestion after reading some of these posts is to remember we are web developers, not local shop owners. By definition our trade is globally reaching regardless of the size of our projects and its no surprise we are seeing that trend become even more ingrained. Find the creative companies out there and show them the tools that inspire you, knowing why, regardless of what language and also look outside your area. Many of the people I work with are in completely different areas of the US and some other countries.\n\nI\'m thankful for this so far civil discussion on the topic, but I would argue against picking a language simply on a couple charts a pretty bad way to look at it for any language. I can argue bias all day with a chart anyone puts out on languages like that, but at the end of the day the logical points made are pretty accurate. In the spirit of things, you can argue about the chart or realize that making that chart with cfchart was probably 10 times easier both in time and brain power than any other standard web application model. The latter argument sells me more than the chart itself.\n\nSorry for my typical long comment.',0,'1','','',0,0),(1250,388,'Paul Klinkenberg','paul@ongevraagdadvies.nl','http://www.coldfusiondeveloper.nl','','2010-06-18 06:27:54','2010-06-18 06:27:54','Couldn\'t agree more!

Yeah, I do most of my work in ColdFusion, but still I find that it is far easier to do complex jobs in ColdFusion than in other languages like PHP. I\'ve also been part of very large ColdFusion projects. One company that I worked for was ranked by Alexa around 2500 in the U.S. and routinely handled 2.5 - 3.0 million ColdFusion page views per day. So I know from experience that ColdFusion Rocks!\n\nI think that part of the reason some of the ColdFusion myths still persist is in part Adobe\'s fault. Adobe needs to do more to get the word out to the Manager types, get into colleges, and get to seasoned programmers. The remaining blames lies in the arrogance of my programming \'religion\' is better than yours mentality. Not much you can do about that.\n\n@Mike Brunt: \"On the weekend of the Indy500, 4 ColdFusion servers handled a peak traffic load of 48,500 concurrent users and did not \"bat an eyelid\"\" -- I would have loved to been there for that!\n\nWil Genovese',0,'1','','',0,0),(1252,388,'Glyn','cfspakry@gmail.com','http://www.cfcoffee.co.uk','','2010-06-19 10:39:26','2010-06-19 10:39:26','UK companies we work with all run on CF apps, Argos, Virgin Mobile, Virgin Money, Zurich, Aviva, O2, Carphone warehouse.

Adobe as a company and the evangelists need to stop throwing random statistics and graphs trying to support their arguments. We have no source for the TCO information on the graph and it doesn\'t take much effort to see some serious problems with it.\n\n- Java annual maintenance costs are approx. 3 times larger than CF. Yet Adobe CF runs on a Java server. How can it be so much less? In maintaining a CF instance, do I not have to maintain the underlining Java server as well?\n\n- If we\'re talking about code maintenance then that really depends on code development and structure. Java forces an OOP style where CF doesn\'t. I would argue Java has a leg up on that point. A lot of the early CF code examples, I think, help create the spaghetti code problems. Today, CF has far better OO attributes, but most CF developers still don\'t use OO principles.\n\n- The differences in training is also seems off to me. Yes, CF is very easy to learn, but so is PHP. The official CF training isn\'t cheap nor effective in my opinion. The graph paints a difference picture.\n\n- The license cost listed for CF with this graph is at the standard pricing level of $1300. In many projects, the requirements will call for the enterprise version which is $7500.\n\n- Development costs are expanding in the CF world. With less available CF developers, the costs of hiring experience is going up. The graph shows it in parity with PHP and .NET.\n\nThis isn\'t a FUD argument. I suspect the TCO will be less for many people using CF, but these stats are sloppy. The main point your making is correct: Yes, CF isn\'t free but really nothing is. The TCO is something many forget in making their early technology decisions.

For some web developers, you may only need a simple admin for some content management and/or a way to capture user information. CF and its easy to understand tags make it easy for someone who understands HTML to jump in and add that kind of functionality.\n\nI believe there are quite a few developers out there that started this way.

A huge part of what we do is on the web in terms of sites and APIs. We use all free solutions if we can.  Here is an example of why.  One Monday morning, we decided that we needed to add 5 web/app servers.  We cloned the existing VMs and in a few hours the new servers we up.  There were no licensing considerations.  If we had to drop $5000 to buy licenses, I suspect we would have gone in a different direction.  One that would have taken longer and impacted our time to market.\n\nLicensed solutions like CF (that cost money) have a place in the web ecosystem.  However, they need to provide clear advantages over the free solutions like PHP, Ruby, Python etc.  It does not appear to me that this is the case.  If the advantages were so clear cut and so much better, usage would be higher. So I doubt that this is really the case.\n\nI suspect that CF is now something like COBOL.  No significant amount of new companies are deciding to use it.  Very few, if any, businesses are switching to it.  If anything they are switching away if they can.  Companies that have existing applications would decide to use it on new projects if they had the staff for it.\n\nIt would be interesting to see a comparison done by a developer who has used both CF and RoR or some other such solution.',0,'1','','',0,0),(1258,388,'Mike Henke','henke.mike@gmail.com','http://www.henke.ws','','2010-09-12 16:59:41','2010-09-12 16:59:41','Again ryanxr, if you don\'t want to pay Adobe ColdFusion for their product, there are other free cf options like Larry pointed about with OpenBD or Railo.

To me its a giant red flashing warning sign to run away as fast as you can, they have a lot of other problems other than being too stingy to purchase CF.\n\nAs for RoR vs CF, that is an invalid comparison, given that RoR is a framework rather than an application server.

We seemed to agree that these large conferences just become too unwieldy and therefore, overly expensive for the conference planners.\n\nI rarely attend conferences because I feel a lot of the content and events are pure fluff. This fluff is expensive. And it adds to the cost of the event for the attendees. I hear cf.O() is very different, but I\'ve yet had a chance to attend.\n\nI firmly believe that the new wave of CF developer conferences need to get rid of this fluff. Limit the number of attendees to keep costs down. If needed, you can do these multiple times per year at a lower cost than having one GIANT conference once a year. It will also keep the event prices lower. Attendees will likely get more value out of the conference due to less fluff.\n\nPersonally, I can do without \"free\" meals at conferences, as well as swag, entertainment, etc. Just keep it to the core. If I am going to spend my hard-earned cash on a conference I want to learn, and I want to learn a lot. I\'ll take care of my own meals and entertainment.

Many of us see ourselves in the role of \"change agent\".  In my organization, one of my primary roles *is* to drive change.  On a day-to-day basis, observable change may be non-existent, and the lack of that visible change can be frustrating.  However, when measured over time (something people who hop from one job to the next over short durations of time may never see), the change is often profound and can be highly rewarding.\n\nAs you said, change isn\'t a destination, it\'s a journey and driving  change in an organization isn\'t really a win/lose proposition. It\'s about continually trying to move the organization forward, even if you sometimes take one step forward and two steps back.',0,'1','','',0,0),(1356,440,'RogerTheGeek','raustin3@nc.rr.com','http://rogerthegeek.wordpress.com/','','2011-02-08 22:12:46','2011-02-08 22:12:46','Excellent points on a subject that is very complex. I also don\'t consider job hopping to be a good thing. I does seem prevalent these days. I like the metaphor of change being a journey. We all need patience during this journey and our paths are not always downhill.\n\nThe idea in my head when I wrote the comments in my review was that some younger workers take a very \"all or nothing\" view and can get very frustrated when they don\'t see immediate acceptance of their ideas. Tactical retreats are sometimes necessary and hopefully we will know when to use them effectively. Over time, people will learn the politics and understand how to move forward even if marginally.\n\nOne resource that would be helpful in understanding tactics and strategies is \"The Art of War\" by Sun Tzu. It is <a href=\"http://classics.mit.edu/Tzu/artwar.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">available on-line</a>. There is a lot of wisdom there that can be used to understand strategies that transcend warfare.\n\nI do believe that people can be too passionate about some issues. There are people who won\'t let go even when their cause is lost. They poison the water so much that they won\'t be taken seriously again by the decision makers. That is why I point out that you need to understand when the battle is lost and not expend all your energy on the unmovable object. You may be able to get what you want by a tactical retreat and movement in another direction. Eventually, things change and you can fight the battle again when management changes or some disaster proves your point. A retreat can allow you time to network with colleagues and management to discuss the issues privately. This can be very effective to plant seeds that grow into the change you believe in.\n\nI plan on passing your book around to younger colleagues and mentees. I do think it is worth reading and describes techniques that can be effective.',0,'1','','',0,0),(1357,441,'Steve Bryant','steve@bryantwebconsulting.com','http://www.bryantwebconsulting.com/','','2011-03-03 12:16:07','2011-03-03 12:16:07','Sounds very impressive!\n\nI especially like the last two.

It can be excruciating to someone who hasn\'t accepted it as part of the mentoring and teaching of a skill. I got somewhat used to it in art classes, but no one ever completely gets comfortable with it. As a craftsperson, you do completely get the idea that it helps you get better. The problem is that few individuals have the skills to be a good critic. The software development community is full of people who know enough to be critics, but very few of them have had to develop the soft skills to pull it off without insulting someone.\n\nAs software craftspeople, we should be able to handle constructive criticism, but we aren\'t usually subjects of it. You don\'t really get it in computer science classes to much of a degree. Folks believe it doesn\'t matter how you get the answer as long as it is correct. Most of us of a certain age believe that quality software code can be written to a higher standard.\n\nA good critic will know the craftsperson and the field well enough to see a piece in the proper light of day. They can zero in on what is missing and what parts of a design can be improved. One analogy can be the black and white photograph. There are two main parts of criticism in photos. One is technical competence and the other is artistic. It doesn\'t matter if you have the once in a lifetime composition if you have scratches or water marks all over the photo. Same with perfect technical and a boring subject.\n\nIt doesn\'t do us any good to accept mediocre work. Of course, we may be under constraints that won\'t allow us to spend the time to redesign and re-code, but we can always try to be better the next time. We can always leave code better than we found it in many ways. I would challenge anyone in an authority role in software development to take the time to mentor coders and to push themselves to be good critics of the work of their staff. That will improve our field in ways that we can measure in ROI or billable hours, but will have a longer lasting legacy.',0,'1','','',0,0),(1434,479,'lindsey simon','lsimon@commoner.com','','','2011-11-22 21:11:01','2011-11-22 21:11:01','Does this rebuild for every platform or only android on the build.phonegap.com side?',0,'1','','',0,0),(1435,479,'Terrence Ryan','terry@terrenceryan.com','http://terrenceryan.com','','2011-11-22 21:58:26','2011-11-22 21:58:26','Every platform.

That line is read-only, as far as I can tell, You show in the video all sort of CSS that I have not been able to find a way to write.

On-Page SEO means more now than ever since the new Google update: Panda. No longer are backlinks and simply pinging or sending out a RSS feed the key to getting Google PageRank or Alexa Rankings, You now NEED On-Page SEO. So what is good On-Page SEO?First your keyword must appear in the title.Then it must appear in the URL.You have to optimize your keyword and make sure that it has a nice keyword density of 3-5% in your article with relevant LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing).

On-Page SEO means more now than ever since the new Google update: Panda. No longer are backlinks and simply pinging or sending out a RSS feed the key to getting Google PageRank or Alexa Rankings, You now NEED On-Page SEO. So what is good On-Page SEO?First your keyword must appear in the title.Then it must appear in the URL.You have to optimize your keyword and make sure that it has a nice keyword density of 3-5% in your article with relevant LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing). Then you should spread all H1,H2,H3 tags in your article.Your Keyword should appear in your first paragraph and in the last sentence of the page. You should have relevant usage of Bold and italics of your keyword.There should be one internal link to a page on your blog and you should have one image with an alt tag that has your keyword....wait there\'s even more Now what if i told you there was a simple Wordpress plugin that does all the On-Page SEO, and automatically for you?

The challenge for this month overall is to work with at least one hour worth of WordCamp video, which you can do by either creating subtitles or editing the video file in preparation for upload to <a href=\"http://WordPress.tv\">WordPress.tv</a>.</p>\n<p>One of the great things about contributing to the video team is that you get to learn so much, since all the work basically involves watching WordCamp presentation videos. Subtitling is a doubly important need, as it is needed to make all those WordCamp videos accessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing and can&#8217;t listen to the audio track, as well as making it possible for the videos to be consumed (in some cases after subtitle translation) by people who speak different languages.</p>\n<p>The challenge will last from Saturday, February 27, 2016 through Sunday, February 28, 2016, and the results will be reviewed afterward by members of the video team.

That challenge had 73 participants, including 10 people who provided 20 or more correct answers to open support threads, thereby winning the challenge. Congratulations to Harris Anastasiadis, Ahmad Awais, Takis Bouyouris, Phil Erb, Eric Gunawan, Jackie McBride, Diana Nichols, Kostas Nicolacopoulos, Juhi Saxena, and Sarah Semark! To them and to everyone else who participated, thank you <strong>so much</strong> for your efforts. Every answer helps, and over the course of this contributor weekend, these amazing volunteers responded to <strong>800 support threads</strong>.

Each event has been assigned a deputy who will meet bi-weekly with the local team to mentor the new WordCamp organizers.</p>\n<p>Andrea Middleton outlined in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2016/05/25/wordcamp-incubator-locations-announcement/\" target=\"_blank\">announcement</a> how the team plans to proceed with getting these events off the ground.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Denpasar, Harare, and Medellín will work with their respective deputies to start a monthly WordPress meetup group or add their existing meetup group to the chapter account program,&#8221; Middleton said. &#8220;Once the local WordPress user group is meeting regularly, each team will work on finding a venue, setting a date, recruiting speakers, and spreading the word about the upcoming WordCamp.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In order to take the pressure off the new organizers, the Community team will assist them in scheduling and finding speakers. The events will be 100% funded by the global sponsorship grant so organizers can focus on community building without the pressure of fundraising. Middleton said they are aiming for no more than three non-local speakers at each event, which she anticipates will happen in the last quarter of 2016.</p>\n<p>The challenge with the Incubator program is to ensure these events are a launching point and not just a flash in the pan. Middleton and the community team deputies are working to establish these emerging communities so that they continue to grow organically after the events conclude.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The goal for these events is to organize an easily reproducible, one-day, one-track event with about 50-75 attendees,&#8221; Middleton said. &#8220;Hopefully by the end of the organizing/incubating experience, members of the local community will feel confident that they can organize an annual WordCamp independently in the years to come.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 31 May 2016 05:12:14 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Donncha: WordPress is thirteen!\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:24:\"http://z9.io/?p=89499890\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:46:\"http://z9.io/2016/05/27/wordpress-is-thirteen/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1231:\"<p>You could have knocked me over with a feather today when I read <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2016/05/wordpress-is-a-teenager/\">Matt&#8217;s post</a> announcing that WordPress was celebrating a birthday!</p>\n<p>It didn&#8217;t seem so long ago that we were working on b2++, hacking the multiuser bits in and doing all sorts of crazy things with it.</p>\n<p>Now I&#8217;m &#8220;typing&#8221; this on a mobile phone by swiping my finger across a virtual keyboard.

According to Jetpack team member Sam Hotchkiss, a stored XSS vulnerability was found in the way that some Jetpack shortcodes are processed, which allows an attacker to insert JavaScript into comments to hijack a visitor&#8217;s browser.</p>\n<p>This particular bug is similar to one <a href=\"https://blog.sucuri.net/2016/05/security-advisory-stored-xss-bbpress-2.html\" target=\"_blank\">recently found and patched in bbPress</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Similar issues may exist in other plugins, and it’s a good reminder about the power of regular expressions to create issues when parsing data,&#8221; Hotchkiss said.</p>\n<p>The Jetpack team has been working with the WordPress security team to push out point releases for all vulnerable branches of the plugin&#8217;s codebase, which includes all versions following 2.0. They are using WordPress&#8217; core automatic update system, so all sites that have not explicitly opted out will receive the security update.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Fortunately, we have no evidence of this being used in the wild,&#8221; Hotchkiss said. &#8220;However, now that this update is public, it’s just a matter of time before someone attempts to exploit it.&#8221; The Jetpack team is advising users to update as soon as possible, as the update also fixes any potential exploits that may have already been put in place.</p>\n<p>The team credits Marc-Alexandre Montpas from <a href=\"https://sucuri.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Sucuri</a> for finding the bug and disclosing it responsibly. Users will be notified about the security release via email, but those who have Akismet and/or VaultPress installed have already been protected since the first reporting of the vulnerability.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 27 May 2016 01:05:10 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"Post Status: Growing a lifestyle business without losing the lifestyle\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=24644\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:50:\"https://poststatus.com/growing-lifestyle-business/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8760:\"<p><em><strong>Editor&#8217;s Note</strong>: This is a guest post by Nate Wright.

You can learn more about Nate on his <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/profiles/nate-wright/\">Post Status profile</a> and follow him on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/natewr\">Twitter</a>.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Here&#8217;s a scenario you&#8217;re probably familiar with: a friend or family member, not terribly tech-savvy, approaches you with an idea. Why don&#8217;t you build Facebook for clowns? What about Uber for sandwiches?</p>\n<p>Their ideas are often a little better than these. Sometimes they&#8217;re worse. But in my case the conversation always gets to the same point in the end.</p>\n<p>You can build stuff on the internet. Why aren&#8217;t you shooting for the stars? Don&#8217;t you want to be rich like Zuckerberg?</p>\n<p>Right now some of you may be thinking: yes I do! This post isn&#8217;t for you.</p>\n<p>This is for those of you who cringe at the thought of your days filling up with hiring and training staff, conducting meetings, or filling out paperwork. Those of you who don&#8217;t want to live the big siloed life of a CEO. Who dove into the WordPress market because you wanted to build things yourself. For yourself.</p>\n<h3>The rockstars and the rest of us</h3>\n<p>It’s hard to find someone more widely admired among WordPress developers &#8212; and more deserving of that admiration &#8212; than <a href=\"https://pippinsplugins.com/about/\">Pippin Williamson</a>. So when he <a href=\"https://pippinsplugins.com/control-give-grow/\">described his evolution</a> from staunch go-it-aloner to team leader, many of us sat up and listened.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://pippinsplugins.com/control-give-grow/#comments\">comments</a> in response to that post exhibit a common mix of anxiety, frustration and hope for us go-it-aloners, who have carved out small (and not so small) niches in the WordPress world.</p>\n<p>We’re overstretched and under resourced. We lack good marketing strategies. And we can see that growth will come from transforming our businesses into larger enterprises.</p>\n<p>But then we start thinking about what that means. The hiring. The firing. The training. The meetings. The paperwork. <i>The liability</i>.</p>\n<p>&#8216;I don’t want to be the next Zuckerberg,&#8217; you may think. Then, hopefully, you’ll laugh at the absurdity. But really, you may think, &#8216;I don’t even want to be the next <a href=\"http://carlhancock.com/\">Carl Hancock</a> or <a href=\"https://yoast.com/author/joost/\">Joost de Valk</a>.&#8217;</p>\n<p>Let me be honest with you. I’ll stop putting words in your mouth and put them in mine.</p>\n<p>I have a lifestyle business. No, I don’t sell lifestyle products. I have a business <em>tailored to my lifestyle</em>.</p>\n<p>I have a business that allows to me to take lunch when I want, finish the day when I want, go on holiday when I want, write the code that I want. That’s my job perk. That’s my killer bonus. No, that’s my Shangri-La.</p>\n<p>When people tell you to hire early or scale quickly, they’re right that giving up control can be liberating. But it can also be encumbering. It brings new responsibilities at the same time that it releases you from old ones.</p>\n<p>Whether or not growing your team is right for you will depend on your temperament, your appetite and the kind of lifestyle you want.</p>\n<h3>Being a little fish in a big pond</h3>\n<p>But let’s be honest. You took a chance on the WordPress market because you saw a window of opportunity. That window may be closing.</p>\n<p>In the last few years we’ve seen a lot of consolidation. The theme market exploded, <a href=\"http://inside.envato.com/envato-stories-muhammad-haris-themefusion-2/\">made millions for a few</a>, and then caused a gold rush which <a href=\"http://scottbolinger.com/wordpress-theme-business/\">saturated the market and pushed out small operators</a>.</p>\n<p>At the same time, two big traditional distribution channels dried up: the official <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/\">WordPress.org theme repository</a>, which has a huge backlog of themes awaiting approval, and <a href=\"https://theme.wordpress.com/\">Automattic’s marketplace</a>, which is closed to new entrants.</p>\n<p>We’re also seeing more traditional investment in WordPress properties. The big one is the <a href=\"http://recode.net/2014/05/05/wordpress-parent-automattic-has-raised-160-million-now-valued-at-1-16-billion-post-money/\">$160 million raised by Automattic</a> and Automattic&#8217;s subsequent <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/automattic-acquired-woocommerce-woothemes/\">acquisition of WooThemes</a>. Many actors are moving more aggressively to leverage or retain their market position. Syed Balkhi is on a buying and building spree (<a href=\"http://enviragallery.com/about-us/\">1</a>, <a href=\"http://optinmonster.com/about/\">2</a>, <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/say-hello-to-wpforms/\">3</a>, <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/syed-balkhi-acquires-google-analytics-by-yoast-renames-to-monsterinsights\">4</a>). Ninja Forms did a <a href=\"https://ninjaforms.com/releasing-three/\">ground-up rebuild</a>. Pippin’s shedding non-essential products (<a href=\"https://pippinsplugins.com/easy-content-types-acquired/\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://pippinsplugins.com/nikhil-vimal-adopts-front-end-registration-and-login-forms-plugin/\">2</a>) and <a href=\"https://pippinsplugins.com/selfish/\">purging some third-party addons</a>.</p>\n<p>The ecosystem looks increasingly unfriendly to us go-it-aloners. Automattic was the first to go big. Given exclusive commercial access to the WordPress trademark, it carved out its own space and split WordPress down the middle. Now the other half &#8212; the WordPress for the rest of us &#8212; is going big too.</p>\n<p>The nice thing about being a small operator is that you only need a tiny sliver of the pie. But as the size of the market has grown, it’s become more difficult to attract attention. Showing up with a good product isn’t enough.</p>\n<h3>Going it alone, together</h3>\n<p>My lifestyle business is working well for me. Revenue keeps inching up. Slowly.</p>\n<p>But it might not make it in a different kind of WordPress space. I’ve been thinking a lot about that lately. And I bet you have too.</p>\n<p>Where’s the market going? What am I willing to trade to survive? Which headaches are <a href=\"http://www.codeinwp.com/blog/transparency-report-14/\">worth changing direction for</a> and which headaches aren’t?</p>\n<p>Here are some of the ideas I’ve been tossing around:</p>\n<h3>Contractors</h3>\n<p>Hiring out. I could scale up or down easily, depending on how well it goes. But it’s tough to manage quality when juggling vendors.</p>\n<p>And what would I contract? I’d like to shed my bumbling efforts in marketing and traffic generation. But that seems like precisely the kind of job full of jackals who don’t know what they’re doing.</p>\n<p>Ok, that’s harsh. I’ll just say: I worry it’d be a headache to manage it well.</p>\n<p>Theme development seems the most plausible, since there’s a large body of talented, hungry themers washing up from the stormy seas of ThemeForest. But it may be the least valuable since the market is being swallowed up by a few big themes.</p>\n<h3>Commissions</h3>\n<p>Affiliate marketing is already working for me. A little. I could go further and recruit theme or plugin developers to sell from my site on commission.</p>\n<p>Then I’m saddled with support for products I didn’t build. Can I maintain quality? Can I drive enough traffic to be an attractive outlet for them? Will I end up with all of the headaches I wanted to avoid?</p>\n<h3>Partnerships</h3>\n<p>Maybe I’ll trade in my king-of-the-hill cap and bring on partners. Not employees. Genuine partners with overlapping skill sets. Instead of being a go-it-aloner we can be two or three go-it-aloners going it alone together!</p>\n<p>Or maybe that’s just a terrible way to run a business.</p>\n<h3>Alliances</h3>\n<p>There are a lot of us out there. Independent themers looking to expand beyond ThemeForest or give up on the old freemium approach of the official repository. Plugin developers looking for a new home or seeking out themes that will integrate with their plugins.</p>\n<p>We could probably do something special if we made stronger alliances. Combined to build to stronger platforms for our products.</p>\n<p>But that sounds like a lot of project management. Isn’t that what we were hoping to avoid?</p>\n<p>I don’t know. I’m going to go write some code.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 26 May 2016 18:10:07 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Nate Wright\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:46:\"WP Mobile Apps: WordPress for iOS: Version 6.2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"http://apps.wordpress.com/?p=3416\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://apps.wordpress.com/2016/05/25/wordpress-for-ios-version-6-2/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3021:\"<p>Hi there, WordPress users! <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wordpress/id335703880?mt=8&uo=6&at=&ct=\">Version 6.2 of the WordPress for iOS app</a> is now available in the App Store.</p>\n<h1>What&#8217;s New:</h1>\n<p><strong>Sharing just got easier!</strong> Post content from apps to your WordPress.com site with a new Share extension.

This post is an assortment of items related to WordPress that caught my eye but didn’t make it into a full post.</p>\n<h2>Chris Lema Launches Beyond Good</h2>\n<p>Chris Lema has launched a new site called <a href=\"http://beyondgood.com/\">Beyond Good </a>that provides insight, tips, and methodologies for leading employees to become better than good. If it&#8217;s anything like his other sites, it&#8217;s sure to be a hit in the WordPress community.</p>\n<h2>Remote Jobs, a Remote Worker Specific Jobs Board</h2>\n<p>Chris Wallace and the team at Lift have launched <a href=\"https://remotejobs.com/\">Remote Jobs</a>, a jobs board specifically catered to remote workers. According to Wallace, &#8220;The site exists to help others find remote jobs that connect them with their passions in life.&#8221; Check out the site as there&#8217;s already a decent listing of opportunities available for remote workers.</p>\n<h2>Why .Blog is Worth $19M</h2>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg participated in a <a href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2016/05/12/the-creator-of-wordpress-on-why-blog-was-worth-19-million/\">phone interview with VentureBeat</a>. The first question in the interview asks why the .blog domain is worth $19M.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Well, the domain business is actually a really good business because you can sell a domain and people use it and keep it forever. So, if you look at like a Verisign, or people who have TLDs, it’s actually an incredible business.</p>\n<p>We really wanted .blog to be open, and some of the other applications for .blog were closed, including Google — so, let’s say for example, only Blogger could have a .blog domain. And we thought that .blog should be open to everyone, even if they’re not using WordPress.</p>\n<p>I gotta be honest though, it was a stressful auction.</p></blockquote>\n<p>There are other tidbits of information included in the interview that I highly encourage you to read. If I were Google, I&#8217;d be upset as .blog is the perfect complimentary domain for Blogger.</p>\n<h2>Drupal Association Gives Community Member a Lifetime Ban</h2>\n<p>DrupalCon New Orleans took place last week and during the event, several speakers <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/node/2729687\">experienced online harassment</a> in the form of derogatory racist, homophobic, and misogynistic comments and images from an anonymous Twitter account. Upon further investigation by community members and the Drupal Association technical and event staff, the harassment was tracked to an attendee at the event.</p>\n<blockquote><p>This person was then confronted by members of the Drupal Association staff and the Community Working Group. They were asked to leave the event and informed that they have been banned from attending any future DrupalCons as well as any events produced by the Drupal Association, in accordance with the <a href=\"https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016/code-conduct\" rel=\"nofollow\">DrupalCon Code of Conduct</a>, which states, &#8216;We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.&#8217; Shortly after the person left the conference, the account from which the harassing tweets were made was deleted.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is an excellent example of why Codes of Conduct exist for events. By the way, check out the <a href=\"https://plan.wordcamp.org/code-of-conduct/\">Code of Conduct</a> that&#8217;s in place for every WordCamp. If you experience harassment of any kind at a WordCamp, please tell event staff.</p>\n<h2>Plans Published to Upgrade WordPress Support Forums</h2>\n<p>Jennifer Dodd published a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2016/05/19/wordpress-org-forums-upgrade/\">detailed plan</a> for migrating the WordPress.org support forums from bbPress 1.x to 2.x. The project is a huge undertaking and involves moving massive amounts of data. If all goes according to plan, the support forums will be on bbPress 2.x by the end of the year. I&#8217;m sure a lot of support forum volunteers are stoked to hear this news.</p>\n<h2>What NOT to Name a WordPress Theme</h2>\n<p>This tweet by Ryan Sullivan gave me a good laugh.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I\'d strongly consider rebranding. <a href=\"https://t.co/9MeevJTlPq\">pic.twitter.com/9MeevJTlPq</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Ryan D. Sullivan (@ryandonsullivan) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ryandonsullivan/status/733120690816065536\">May 19, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Tom McFarlin on Improving the WordPress Plugin UX</h2>\n<p>Tom McFarlin published a <a href=\"https://tommcfarlin.com/wordpress-plugin-user-experience-2/\">great article</a> that offers ideas on how plugin developers can improve the WordPress plugin user experience. His first suggestion is a key reason I think GravityForms became successful.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Try to make sure that your project tightly integrates with the core WordPress user interface.</p></blockquote>\n<p>When I witnessed GravityForms for the first time in 2009, I loved how it integrated into the WordPress backend as if it were a part of the core software. Fast forward to 2016 and plugins that tie into a service are experimenting with overlay interfaces that replace WordPress&#8217;. The most recent example I recall is WP Forms <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wpforms-aims-to-be-the-most-beginner-friendly-forms-plugin-for-wordpress\">that I reviewed</a> earlier this year.</p>\n<p>In my review, I specifically noted that the interface the developers used allowed me to focus on creating forms. It doesn&#8217;t seem like it&#8217;s a WordPress core feature and it didn&#8217;t have too. While the advice McFarlin gives is likely accurate for most cases, there are plugins that benefit from having a unique user interface different from WordPress&#8217;.</p>\n<h2>Don&#8217;t Edit Core</h2>\n<p>This comic <a href=\"http://www.commitstrip.com/en/2016/05/17/coder-dilemma-9-the-upgrade/\">created by CommitStrip</a> made me smile.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Coder Dilemma #9 &#8211; The Upgrade<br /> <a href=\"https://t.co/2Tu2l1tgYX\">https://t.co/2Tu2l1tgYX</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/xnMr2VdYWv\">pic.twitter.com/xnMr2VdYWv</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; CommitStrip (@CommitStrip) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CommitStrip/status/732505464768843776\">May 17, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Wapuu Tattoo!</h2>\n<p>In what is a traditional part of this series, I end each issue by featuring a Wapuu design. For those who don&#8217;t know, Wapuu is the <a href=\"http://wapuu.jp/2015/12/12/wapuu-origins/\">unofficial mascot</a> of the WordPress project. WordCamp St. Louis 2016, took place last weekend and one of the attendees had a Wapuu tattoo! Wapuu looks good everywhere, including human skin!</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Wapuu has been sighted at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/wcstl?src=hash\">#wcstl</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/wordpress?src=hash\">#wordpress</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/wapuu?src=hash\">#wapuu</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/4HYlp6GI0S\">pic.twitter.com/4HYlp6GI0S</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Nile Flores (@blondishnet) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/blondishnet/status/731504592668758017\">May 14, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>That&#8217;s it for issue nine.

In an effort to iterate on the page&#8217;s layout, the Meta Team has <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2016/05/19/plugin-directory-prototypes/\">published prototypes</a> of a new design for the <a href=\"http://codepen.io/mapk/full/jqxqbo/\">plugin directory&#8217;s home</a> and <a href=\"http://codepen.io/mapk/full/KzGQKv/\">search results pages</a>.</p>\n<p>The prototypes are inspired by <a href=\"https://get.wp.com/\">Get WordPress</a>, a landing page that provides key information about the WordPress project at a glance.</p>\n<p>There are a few things to keep in mind while looking at these prototypes. The first is that plugin information displayed on the page is inaccurate. Second, the Pro and Light classifications are for design purposes only. Third, links at the bottom will point to their corresponding pages.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/PluginDirectoryMockup1.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-55007\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/PluginDirectoryMockup1.png?resize=1025%2C2753\" alt=\"WordPress Plugin Directory Homepage Protoype\" /></a>WordPress Plugin Directory Homepage Protoype\n<p>Unlike the current design, the prototype displays far less information. Authors, Last Updated, Compatibility, and Active Installs are absent from the homepage view. Initial feedback <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2016/05/19/plugin-directory-prototypes/#comment-8151\">highlights the concern</a> that too much information has been stripped away.</p>\n<p>In response to a comment on the announcement post, Samuel Sidler, <span class=\"st\">Apollo Team Lead at Automattic and contributor to the Meta team</span>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2016/05/19/plugin-directory-prototypes/#comment-8154\">explains</a> why he doesn&#8217;t think the information is useful to users.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Author, as you said, is only really useful for insiders. The latter two, meanwhile, are already taken into account in the search results. If a plugin doesn’t have a recent compatible version, it will move down the list. If it’s too old, it won’t get shown at all (which is the case today).</p>\n<p>Active installs is more interesting, but we account for it weighting search results as-is. I actually find it refreshing to <em>not</em> show the active installs as it allows for less-popular plugins to get more downloads. Users will be less likely to click the popular plugins (outside of familiar names) and more likely to find the plugin they actually need.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Another commenter suggests <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/awakensolutions/\">creating a simple/advanced view. </a>By default, the page could display a simplistic design while giving power users an option for more details.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Just like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/philosophy/\" rel=\"nofollow\">WordPress core</a>, we strive to design for the majority and build features for the 80%,&#8221; Sidler said in response to the comment. &#8220;An &#8216;advanced&#8217; view doesn’t meet that requirement, in my eyes.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Meta team is iterating quickly and will soon publish a prototype of the plugin details page.

The <a href=\"https://bpdevel.wordpress.com/2016/05/11/buddypress-style-modules/\" target=\"_blank\">Style Modules</a> project will aggregate community-submitted code that enhances BuddyPress components in a plug-and-play manner.</p>\n<p>Developers who want to contribute to the project can submit their modules by creating a ticket on <a href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/newticket\" target=\"_blank\">BP trac</a> and attaching a zip file that includes the CSS/JS files, a readme.md, and a screenshot.</p>\n<p>Users who want to add a module will need to create a /style-modules/ directory and then unzip the module inside it. The next step requires the user to copy functions from the module&#8217;s readme file to their theme&#8217;s functions.php file, a step which provides a significant hurdle for a non-technical BuddyPress community manager.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Initially this is a trial to see whether we get sufficient interest in the concept to continue and develop further, perhaps enhancing the loading process with enqueueing of files based on directory scanning and loading of files as an array but run from the core theme compat class, removing the need for users to copy the loading functions to their functions file,&#8221; Ashmore said.</p>\n<p>The project&#8217;s GitHub repository includes <a href=\"https://github.com/buddypress/style-modules/wiki/Style-Modules-Listings\">an example module</a> that re-styles the members list into a grid layout. Other example ideas Ashmore suggested include a new look for profile entries, a different presentation for the activity posting form, or something as simple as changing the font size for the activity stream.</p>\n<p>The experimental initiative will test the waters to see if the BuddyPress community will chip in to provide enough modules to make this a real library. The support policy stated in the proposal doesn&#8217;t offer much incentive for module authors to submit their work:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Provision of modules and use of them is entirely the discretion of the authors and users, while BP will run some basic checks on the module BP does not guarantee that the modules will work in all given situations or installs, or accept any liability in their use. Support for a module remains the responsibility of the author to ensure the continued effectiveness of the module with updates to themes, WP or BP.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Historically, BuddyPress has struggled to present itself as an easily customizable solution for communities. <a href=\"http://codex.buddypress.org/themes/theme-compatibility-1-7/a-quick-look-at-1-7-theme-compatibility/\" target=\"_blank\">Theme compatibility</a>, introduced in April 2013, made it easier to use BP with any theme, but unless you purchase a theme specifically designed for the plugin, its default output is rather generic and in need of heavy styling.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://bpdevel.wordpress.com/2016/05/11/buddypress-style-modules/\" target=\"_blank\">BuddyPress Style Modules</a> concept is an attempt to make it easier for community managers to enhance BP components with different looks, but the project will need to provide a compelling reason for developers to contribute modules and continue to maintain them.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 19 May 2016 02:34:32 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"WPTavern: The .blog Domain Extension Is Now Open to Registrars\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=54971\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"http://wptavern.com/the-blog-domain-extension-is-now-open-to-registrars\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2083:\"<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/blogging.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/blogging.jpg?resize=960%2C521\" alt=\"photo credit: Luis Llerena\" class=\"size-full wp-image-54799\" /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"https://stocksnap.io/photo/3ZHG0XOIT6\">Luis Llerena</a>\n<p>Today marks a moment in internet history, as the very first .blog domain is now operational on WordPress.com. Knock Knock, WHOIS There, a subsidiary of Automattic, launched <a href=\"https://nic.blog/\" target=\"_blank\">Nic.blog</a> today to begin getting registrars to sign up to sell the new TLD.</p>\n<p>Automattic <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/automattic-to-oversee-the-sale-and-registration-of-top-level-blog-domains\" target=\"_blank\">won the rights to oversee the sale and registration of the .blog domain</a> in 2015 via a bidding process that is estimated to have closed around $20 million. The domain extension is so new that Twitter doesn&#8217;t yet support it as a valid link, but Automattic expects to activate 250,000 new names in 2016.</p>\n<p>According to the new nic.blog information site, registrars that sign up to sell .blog domains will be able to participate in an incentive partnership model that rewards a higher volume of sales:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Pricing will be in the standard range for new gTLDs, with premium names available in several tiers. High margins for registrars will be guaranteed by an incentive model, rewarding sales above a certain baseline. Final terms will be published in the coming weeks.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Automattic is opening up the .blog TLD to registrars around the world and companies can sign up on nic.blog to learn more about the requirements. Individuals who are interested in purchasing a .blog domain should review the tentative <a href=\"https://nic.blog/launch-plan/\" target=\"_blank\">launch plan</a> published today. Registration will be open to trademark owners during the Sunrise period starting in August 2016, followed by a Landrush period in October.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 18 May 2016 23:26:09 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:87:\"WPTavern: After Eight Years, Thematic Theme’s Lead Developers Discontinue the Project\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=54967\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"http://wptavern.com/after-eight-years-thematic-themes-lead-developers-discontinue-the-project\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3812:\"<p>Gene Robinson, lead developer of the Thematic WordPress theme, has <a href=\"http://thematictheme.com/2016/05/15/thematic-retrospective/\">announced</a> that the project will no longer be developed. Thematic <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/thematic/\">was last updated</a> in 2013 and is actively installed on more than 4K sites. Users are advised to migrate to a different theme as updates will no longer be released. As WordPress core evolves, sites using Thematic may develop incompatibilities.</p>\n<h2>Continuing The Legacy with a Different Name</h2>\n<p>Although development on Thematic is discontinuing, Robinson has forked the project and renamed it to <a href=\"http://d.eciduo.us\">Deciduous. </a>The project picks up where Thematic leaves off. Those interested in continuing development can <a href=\"https://github.com/emhr/Deciduous\">follow it on GitHub</a> where pull requests are welcomed. Robinson is also seeking links to other projects that are derivative of Thematic.</p>\n<h2>Where to Get Support for Thematic</h2>\n<p>Users who need support are advised to post on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/theme/thematic\">WordPress.org support forums</a> for the Thematic theme, &#8220;The support forums on the Thematic website are shutting down due to the lack of community involvement, moderation, and developer feedback,&#8221; Robinson said. &#8220;Hopefully the greater WordPress support community will be able to help you find a resolution.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>A Look Back</h2>\n<p>The years 2008-2009 is an interesting time frame in WordPress&#8217; history. A number of commercial theme and plugin companies, WordPress-centric sites, and projects were launched. Among these was the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20080611165821/http://themeshaper.com/thematic-for-wordpress/\">Thematic theme</a> by Ian Stewart, theme Wrangler for Automattic. Thematic was more than just a theme, it was an opportunity for Stewart to learn how WordPress&#8217; theme system works.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ThematicThemePreview.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-54981\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ThematicThemePreview.png?resize=951%2C740\" alt=\"Thematic Theme Preview from WordPress.org\" /></a>Preview of Thematic from WordPress.org\n<p>He regularly shared his knowledge with the community through <a href=\"https://themeshaper.com/\">ThemeShaper.com</a>, a site now owned by Automattic that features contributions from other members of the theme team. It was the wild west of theme development in 2008 and any person who regularly shared theme development techniques became an influential member of the community.</p>\n<p>Two years after launching Thematic, Stewart <a href=\"https://themeshaper.com/2010/03/04/ian-stewart-joined-automattic/\">joined Automattic</a> as a theme wrangler.</p>\n<blockquote><p>What can I say besides awesome, awesome, awesome? The enormous opportunity for learning and improvement; all the super-talented, friendly people; the chance to work on so many really, really cool projects—it’s almost unbelievable. This is a dream job for me.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The hiring allowed him to make available all of his commercial child themes built on the Thematic framework available free of charge to the community.</p>\n<h2>Did You Learn From Thematic?</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s bittersweet and slightly nostalgic to see the theme come to an end. When I launched the Tavern in 2009, I regularly linked to tutorials and articles published by Stewart. I&#8217;m almost certain Thematic and its creator helped out a number of budding theme developers between 2008-2011. Let us know in the comments if you used Thematic for any projects or what you learned from its code.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 18 May 2016 20:45:48 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"Post Status: WordPress as a Headless CMS — Draft podcast\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=24518\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-headless-cms-draft-podcast/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2870:\"<p>Welcome to the Post Status <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/category/draft\">Draft podcast</a>, which you can find <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008\">on iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://play.google.com/music/m/Ih5egfxskgcec4qadr3f4zfpzzm?t=Post_Status__Draft_WordPress_Podcast\">Google Play</a>, <a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast\">Stitcher</a>, and <a href=\"http://simplecast.fm/podcasts/1061/rss\">via RSS</a> for your favorite podcatcher.

Easy Updates Manager is a free plugin that&#8217;s active on more than 70k sites. It&#8217;s maintained by <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/kidsguide/\">Matthew</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/ronalfy/\">Ronald Huereca</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/roary86/\">Roary Tubbs</a>, and <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/bigwing/\">BigWing Interactive</a>.</p>\n<h2>Countless Number of Configurations Available</h2>\n<p>Once activated, you&#8217;ll find the options page by browsing to Dashboard &gt; Update Options. There are two different interfaces for configuring updates. The first includes a number of toggle switches that disable/enable updates. The second is a traditional screen with radial buttons.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/EasyUpdateManagerDashboard.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-54959\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/EasyUpdateManagerDashboard.png?resize=1025%2C432\" alt=\"Easy Update Manager Dashboard\" /></a>Easy Updates Manager Dashboard\n<p>Traditional settings page for Easy Updates Manager.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/EasyUpdateManagerGeneralSettings.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-54960\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/EasyUpdateManagerGeneralSettings.png?resize=566%2C480\" alt=\"Easy Update Manager General Settings\" /></a>Easy Updates Manager General Settings\n<p>One of the highlights of Easy Updates Manager is the ability to enable automatic updates for individual themes and plugins. It&#8217;s a convenient way to update themes and plugins that rarely cause issues. There&#8217;s also a built-in logging feature that when enabled creates a new table in the database. It logs the username, update type, version, action, status, and date.</p>\n<p>Logging is listed as a beta feature and should be used at your own risk. It also may not work with all commercial themes and plugins. Here&#8217;s what the log looks like after I updated three plugins.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/EasyUpdateManagerLogs.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-54961\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/EasyUpdateManagerLogs.png?resize=1025%2C350\" alt=\"Easy Update Management Log\" /></a>Easy Updates Management Log\n<p>Easy Updates Manager also includes the ability to exclude users from manipulating the plugin&#8217;s settings. The plugin contains additional features that I encourage you to explore by using it on a test site.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the number of options available, users have a countless number of update configurations to choose from. I tested the plugin on WordPress 4.6 alpha and it works as expected.

This allows those who navigate with keyboards to access the Add New Tag or Add New Category area first.</p>\n<p>Andrea Fercia, WordPress core committer and a member of the accessibility team, explains why the changes matter, &#8220;For accessibility, the visual order should always match the tab order. The main functionality in a page should just be the first thing in the source markup and other parts of the user interface should never be &#8216;skipped&#8217;.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The following image shows the tab order of elements on the Tag management screen in WordPress 4.5. In order to reach the Add New Tag section, you need to tab through a number of checkboxes, each tag in the tag cloud, and various quick edit links.

This new feature allows community managers to easily edit BuddyPress-generated emails in the admin and make design changes in the customizer.</p>\n<p>It didn&#8217;t take long for developers to think of bringing this same customizability to bbPress emails. <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/thebrandonallen/\" target=\"_blank\">Brandon Allen</a> has just released <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/bp-emails-for-bbp/\" target=\"_blank\">BP Emails for BBP</a>, a plugin that sends forum and topic subscription emails using the new BP Email API.</p>\n<p>Once installed, administrators will find templates for new forum topics and topic replies under the same Emails menu item with the 16 customizable BuddyPress core emails.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/buddypress-bbpress-emails.png\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/buddypress-bbpress-emails.png?resize=1025%2C305\" alt=\"buddypress-bbpress-emails\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-54878\" /></a></p>\n<p>Allen noted that the plugin sends emails differently than bbPress, which puts every subscriber email in the BCC field and sends one email. Instead, it sends a separate email to each subscriber, which Allen said may improve deliverability given that some email providers look unfavorably on emails with large BCC fields.</p>\n<p>I tested the plugin and found that it works as advertised for customizing and sending bbPress emails. There are no settings to configure. It simply adds the same functionality that users now expect from BuddyPress core emails with all the same customization options.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/bbpress-subscription-email.png\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/bbpress-subscription-email.png?resize=1025%2C500\" alt=\"bbpress-subscription-email\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-54929\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/bp-emails-for-bbp/\" target=\"_blank\">BP Emails for BBP</a> is available on WordPress.org.

Gorges summarized the changes to how BuddyPress will handle navigation in the upcoming 2.6 release:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The new BP_Core_Nav overhauls the way that BuddyPress registers, stores, and renders navigation items. Navigations are now component-specific, eliminating the potential for confusion and conflict between navigation items with similar names in different components, and opening the possibility of generating navs for separate objects of the same type on a single pageload.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The previous navigation system used bp_nav and bp_options_nav, global properties that managed nav and subnav across all of BuddyPress&#8217; components. Developers had a difficult time extending navigation and sometimes ended up stepping on each other&#8217;s toes when adding similar navigation items.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The new system eliminates most of these problems, by removing direct access to the underlying navigation data, while providing a full-fledged API for accessing and modifying that data,&#8221; Gorges said.</p>\n<p>Although the new API ensures backward compatibility with the legacy bp_nav and bp_options_nav, plugin developers whose extensions depend on these methods will want to update their code.

The 2.5 hour <a href=\"https://learnredux.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Learn Redux</a> course includes 20 videos that guide developers through building an example &#8216;Reduxstagram&#8217; app to present the core ideas behind Redux.</p>\n<p>To get the most out of Learn Redux, students should have a decent foundation of React and ES6. Bos recommends those who are not comfortable with React to start with his <a href=\"https://reactforbeginners.com/\" target=\"_blank\">React for Beginners</a> course.</p>\n<p>After you sign up, you&#8217;ll receive an email with a link to the starter files and access to the videos. The example app uses Webpack to bundle ES6 modules into a single JavaScript file, so the course begins with a video on using NPM and Webpack to set up a local development environment.

Bachhuber discussed his recent experience crowdfunding his work on &#8220;<a href=\"https://wp-cli.org/restful/\" target=\"_blank\">A More RESTful WP-CLI</a>&#8221; as well as the challenges he&#8217;s encountered as a contributor to various open source projects over the years.</p>\n<p>In the first part of the episode, Bachhuber shared how he spent the 283 hours of time that the WordPress community funded to advance the WP-CLI and WP REST API projects. The funding gave him the opportunity to dedicate time split between the two projects. Bachhuber put in approximately 95 hours towards the REST API in January and February but the bulk of the hours went towards making WP-CLI more friendly for developers who work with the REST API.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WordPress developers are going to be putting a lot of time now towards writing REST endpoints that expose their functionality to the world, and it would be really nice if WP-CLI interoperated nicely with that and allowed you to use that functionality at the command line without having to separately write your own WP-CLI commands,&#8221; Bachhuber said.</p>\n<p>He discussed the challenge of scoping out this broad goal and what he learned about crowdfunding during the process.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The RESTful WP-CLI kickstarter project was intentionally ambitious, because I&#8217;m a guy who has big ideas and likes to do big things,&#8221; Bachhuber said. &#8220;There are some things I feel really happy that I&#8217;ve been able to ship and produce so far, and there are other features that, for one reason or another, I haven&#8217;t quite been able to execute  yet and that&#8217;s a bit frustrating.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a whole different ball game trying to manage the expectations of your Kickstarter backers than it is a single client. I&#8217;ve got 107 clients that I have to make happy,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Bachhuber said he was able to get the issue backlog for WP-CLI down to less than 60 issues and the dedicated time has allowed him to resolve old issues that have &#8220;languished since the dawn of time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As part of the rewards offered for contributors to the crowdfunding campaign, Bachhuber offered his time consulting with individuals and organizations, which he found to be easier than traditional physical swag rewards.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really glad that I chose [consulting] over having to give out physical swag, because it&#8217;s very difficult to procure and ship to everyone, particularly when you have international backers,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Even though I&#8217;ve spent a lot of my time fulfilling the rewards and talking with people and having calls with them and meeting up with them in person, it&#8217;s a much easier effort to manage than sending 100 coffee mugs across the world.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When asked if he&#8217;d do it again, Bachhuber said yes but emphasized that spending this much time on an open source project only works if you keep a healthy balance with other aspects of life.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s really important that if you&#8217;re contributing to open source projects on a regular basis or even maintaining them, that you balance your time between that and other things,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s really easy to get burned out on said open source project if you spend 100% of your time on it for a whole month or six months.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was pretty intentional to say that the money I was raising was going to cover my involvement with the project for six months, a certain number of hours, and that it was going to be a part-time thing. That was a really healthy way to approach it. I think I would have gotten burned out if I had just tried to dive into it, crank it out, and move on to the next thing,&#8221; Bachhuber said.</p>\n<h3>The Emotional Challenges of Working on Open Source Projects</h3>\n<p>During the course of the interview Bachhuber was asked to share his feelings on what he referred to as &#8220;the kerfuffle with the REST API&#8221; that happened in February. The REST API team had written a merge proposal in September 2015 that recommended merging the API in two parts &#8211; the infrastructure in 4.4 and the posts, comments, terms, and users endpoints in 4.5 or 4.6. After partially executing on that proposal, the team held a status chat to discuss the plan moving forward.</p>\n<p>Bachhuber said that the discussion became &#8220;a very emotionally fraught event&#8221; after Matt Mullenweg said the project needed feature parity with the WordPress admin before any of the endpoints could be considered for merge. After putting hundreds of hours into the project alongside a handful of dedicated contributors who were already spread thin, he found this new requirement was a difficult pill to swallow.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For better or for worse, as a maintainer or even a participant of an open source project, you have to have a thick skin and realize that all the time the decisions that are made are not about you &#8211; they are about the project,&#8221; Bachhuber said. &#8220;Even if you are personally offended by the decision, it doesn&#8217;t matter because it isn&#8217;t about you. It&#8217;s really difficult to deal with emotionally.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bachhuber&#8217;s years of contributing to and maintaing open source projects has taught him a few things about managing stress and conflict that <a href=\"https://2016.europe.wordcamp.org/session/my-condolences-youre-now-the-maintainer-of-a-popular-open-source-project/\" target=\"_blank\">he plans to share at WordCamp Europe</a> in a talk titled, &#8220;My condolences, You&#8217;re now the maintainer of a popular OS project.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I find a lot of joy in maintaining open source projects,&#8221; Bachhuber said. &#8220;I also have to actively work to address the emotional side of the equation to make sure I&#8217;m in a healthy space to continue maintaining the project and the project is not affecting me personally. It&#8217;s taken me years to come to a point where I&#8217;m comfortable with that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the case of the WP REST API, Bachhuber has come to a place where he can compartmentalize his emotional reactions and responses to the differing opinions.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve come to a point now where I care but I don&#8217;t care,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I care in the sense that I&#8217;d still love to see those endpoints go into core and see the fruits of our labors realized. I don&#8217;t care because I&#8217;m not emotionally attached to that happening on any particular time frame. I honestly would rather it happen when it&#8217;s ready to happen over prematurely, and I realize I might not be the best qualified person to make that decision.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the remainder of the episode, Bachhuber and Carr discuss React, Redux, Karma, Enzyme, and other tools for testing and developing with the REST API.

In mid 2015, Matt Mullenweg, co-founder of the open source WordPress project, <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/the-recommended-hosting-page-on-wordpress-org-starts-over-from-scratch\">announced</a> the page would be revamped. To have a chance at being listed webhosting companies needed to fill out a 40-question survey.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/RecommendedHostsPage.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-54844\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/RecommendedHostsPage.png?resize=790%2C642\" alt=\"2016 Recommended Hosts Page\" /></a>2016 Recommended Hosts Page\n<p>This is Flywheel&#8217;s first time on the page. <a href=\"https://getflywheel.com/\">Flywheel</a>, launched in 2013, is a managed WordPress hosting company with an emphasis towards designers and agencies. I asked Dusty Davidson, c<span class=\"team__role\">o-Founder and CEO of Flywheel</span>, what it means to be included on the page. &#8220;We&#8217;re obviously excited to be included, and think it really reflects on the work we&#8217;ve done to create a great experience for WordPress users,&#8221; he<span class=\"team__role\"> said. </span></p>\n<p>The recommended webhosting page on WordPress.org is incredibly lucrative. Based on conversations I&#8217;ve had with employees of hosts listed, it can generate millions of dollars in revenue. I asked Davidson what impact this will have on his company, &#8220;<span class=\"team__role\">I&#8217;m sure it will undoubtedly send a good deal of traffic, but honestly we&#8217;re just humbled and excited to be recognized,&#8221; he said. </span></p>\n<h2>A New Round of Controversy</h2>\n<p>Over the years, companies have come and gone from the recommended hosting page. However, Bluehost in particular has consistently appeared on the list, including the most recent iteration. Bluehost is owned by <a href=\"http://www.endurance.com/\">Endurance International Group</a> who <a href=\"http://www.prweb.com/releases/2014/05/prweb11874425.htm\">invested in Automattic</a> in 2014. Because Mullenweg is the CEO of Automattic and controls who is listed on the page, it&#8217;s easy to see why it regularly generates controversy.</p>\n<p>Kevin Ohashi of ReviewSignal.com, <a href=\"http://reviewsignal.com/blog/2016/05/12/wordpress-org-updates-hosting-recommendations-nobody-knows-selection-criteria/\">criticized the lack of transparency</a> regarding the process for how hosts.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Who is responsible for this revamp? What were the selection criteria? How often will it be updated? Will existing companies be continuously re-evaluated?</p></blockquote>\n<p>These are important questions to ask and there are no publicly documented answers. In a follow up post, <a href=\"http://reviewsignal.com/blog/2016/05/13/wordpress-org-hosting-recommendations-listing-criteria/\">Ohashi investigated</a> what criteria needs to be met for being listed on the page. The post contains a number of screenshots of his private conversation with <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/macmanx\">James Huff</a>, who has volunteered for the WordPress project for 12 years and has worked at Automattic for five years.</p>\n<p>Huff was directly related to the project and influenced who was chosen thanks to his involvement on the WordPress Support Team. Within the conversation, he shares details of the process and mentions that no money exchanged hands. Early in the conversation, Ohashi tells Huff that he wants to learn and publish how the process works. However, Huff had no idea that everything he said would be made public.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was invited to what sounded like a friendly chat over direct message from a concerned community member, after he was referred to me by a friend,&#8221; Huff said. &#8220;At no point was it clarified or even implied that anything discussed would be made public.&#8221;</p>\n<p><del>Conversations held in a private matter should remain private unless given permission to publish them, something I discovered the hard way.</del> Unfortunately, the post comes across as a public interrogation of Huff. I asked Huff, who was shaken by the experience, how it has affected him moving forward as it relates to the WordPress project.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be lying if I said my feelings weren&#8217;t at least shaken by the experience, especially considering how polite he was to my friend and how hostile he was towards me apparently just because I work for Automattic, but this isn&#8217;t the first time that has happened to me and I don&#8217;t expect it to be the last,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s an usually prevalent negative bias against Automatticians who contribute to WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Mullenweg Provides Clarification</h2>\n<p>Mullenweg <a href=\"http://reviewsignal.com/blog/2016/05/13/wordpress-org-hosting-recommendations-listing-criteria/#comment-1011\">commented on the post</a> where he not only sticks up for Huff, but answers some of the controversial questions raised by Ohashi. Mullenweg explains how the applicants were chosen, how the criteria is weighted, who makes the final decisions, and how much money is involved. Here is his comment in full.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8216;I would like to see some transparency in the process&#8217;</p>\n<p>As stated on the page, the listing is completely arbitrary. The process was: There was a survey, four applicants were chosen, and the page was updated. That might repeat later in the year, or the process might change.</p>\n<p>&#8216;how criteria are weighted&#8217;</p>\n<p>There is no criteria or weighting. It ultimately is one person’s opinion. Information that is important is reflected in the questions asked in the survey, but that is not everything that is taken into account. (I have looked at this site in the past, for example.)</p>\n<p>&#8216;who is making the decisions&#8217;</p>\n<p>I am. James helped in sorting through the many submissions that came in, doing additional research, and digging on finalists, but ultimately the decision was mine. You can and should blame me fully for any issues you have with it. I appreciate James’ help in this go-round, but he will not be involved at all with any future updates. (So, please leave him alone.)</p>\n<p>&#8216;how much money is involved&#8217;</p>\n<p>There was no money involved. Obviously being listed on the page is hugely valuable and impacts the listed (or unlisted) businesses a great deal. This is why I take full responsibility for the listing, now and in the future — I have been fortunate to be extraordinarily successful and no financial or business consideration any of the applicants could offer matters to me. A host could offer $100,000,000 to be listed on the page for 1 day, and I would say no.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s unfortunate that the information in Mullenweg&#8217;s comment is not published in an official post announcing the changes to the recommended hosting page. If an official post was published that included the same information in his comment, it&#8217;s possible it would have eliminated most of the confusion, uncertainty, and doubt surrounding it.</p>\n<h2>Should WordPress.org Have a Recommended Hosting Page?</h2>\n<p>Due to the investments EIG has made in Automattic, Mullenweg&#8217;s role at the company, and him making the final decisions, there will always be a potential conflict of interest despite taking full responsibility of the page and the processes associated with it.</p>\n<p>Should WordPress.org have a recommended hosting page? What if the page was replaced with information people could use to make informed decisions on choosing a host?

The company uses WordPress as a command center for the application that communicates with various restaurant-tech APIs to deliver information to the dashboard in realtime.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We started with the website builder a while back,&#8221; Founder and CEO Noel Tock said. &#8220;It’s been a great ride, but we realized two things: 1) Website builders have become a race to the bottom with regards to revenue as well as extremely competitive, and 2) From our many conversations with restaurants, their challenges have become much larger; consolidating data and insights from all the products they now use.&#8221;</p>\n<p>One of the Happytables beta restaurants in London uses 14 different applications to manage its sales, operations, and marketing, and Tock says this trend is only growing.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The centre of gravity is shifting from the Point of Sale to a very fragmented collection of siloed products (reservations, online ordering, staff scheduling/wages, loyalty, waitlist, social, etc.),&#8221; Tock said. &#8220;Becoming that 30,000 foot view whilst generating actionable insights across the portfolio of applications is the challenge we’ve taken on with the new Happytables.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The first installation of the new Happytables was set up for <a href=\"http://whyteandbrown.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Whyte &amp; Brown</a> in London where the team is focusing their beta testing. The application currently aggregates data from POS (Point of Sale) and Social, but Tock says this will rapidly evolve to providing various insights from POS and Labor, such as revenue forecasting, employee performance, and breakfast/lunch/dinner performance.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s been very exciting working towards actionable insights, whereby we can tell a waiter that he/she was underselling a certain product or category compared to their colleagues, or that a particular employee performs a lot better on lunch then on dinner,&#8221; Tock said.</p>\n<p>Below you can see an example of Happytables&#8217; latest kitchen dashboard, using the team view as opposed to the individual employee recommendations/suggestions view.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Happytables_kitchen_dashboard.png\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Happytables_kitchen_dashboard.png?resize=1025%2C731\" alt=\"Happytables_kitchen_dashboard\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-54833\" /></a></p>\n<p>The new Happytables uses WordPress as a backend and the WP REST API and ReactJS on the frontend.  Although the development team still uses WordPress as one of its core technologies, the infrastructure is a bit more complicated.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s not pure WordPress for the data storage,&#8221; CTO Aaron Jorbin said. &#8220;In fact, very little of it is actually stored inside WordPress. It is used to store some information about the restaurant and manage requests to third parties where we fetch the data and then store it in DynamoDB.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The screenshots in this post show the WordPress theme in full screen mode, but Jorbin said the restaurant staff never interact with wp-admin. Restaurant operators use the app to view all the realtime information coming in so that they can make better decisions about how they run their businesses.</p>\n<p>Happytables is still hosting its customers from its first iteration as a website builder, but Tock said most are not good candidates for the beta.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The infrastructure is quite different now as we’re capturing different types of data (previously web content, now largely transactional data),&#8221; he said. &#8220;Our customers on the website builder platform came from all walks of life, so there’s not many who fit the ideal beta candidate (using Micros/Aloha as POS, based in London, run a multiunit restaurant, etc.).</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re just looking to see how we can fit this into the larger Happytables model downstream,&#8221; Tock said. &#8220;If we’re going to implement so many API’s, there’s also value in tying those back to the website.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Not many aspects of the new infrastructure have been open sourced yet, as the team has been moving fast. Tock said they hope to make some of their code public further down the road after it&#8217;s been tested.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Once we’re past testing/beta, I’m sure a number of features will become more mature tools and move into their own public repo if they are of that sort of benefit,&#8221; he said. The new infrastructure is one of the many exciting ways that the WP REST API is being used to bring a host of information into WordPress from various third party applications and tie it all together in a useful way.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 13 May 2016 19:45:25 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:19:\"Matt: Mom on Tinder\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=46572\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:36:\"https://ma.tt/2016/05/mom-on-tinder/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:227:\"<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a fun Friday read, <a href=\"http://www.gq.com/story/my-mom-ran-my-tinder\">check out this story of a young GQ writer who gave control of his Tinder account to his Mom</a>.

Individual developers are the most likely customers to benefit from the changes, but many organizations will see an exponential increase in pricing.</p>\n<p>GitLab, a competitor in the Git repository hosting space, immediately addressed disgruntled GitHub customers with a <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/2016/05/11/git-repository-pricing/\" target=\"_blank\">pricing comparison</a> on the company&#8217;s blog. Co-founder and CEO <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sytses\" target=\"_blank\">Sid Sijbrandij</a> noted that the three main players in this space, GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab, all offer unlimited private repositories but that it doesn&#8217;t cost companies more to host additional repositories for a given user.</p>\n<p>Sijbrandij attributes the change to the increase in the <a href=\"https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/build-us-microservices/\" target=\"_blank\">microservices model</a>, a development approach that breaks software down into smaller, related pieces that communicate with one another via APIs.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As more and more developers, teams, and organizations seek out the advantages of microservices, they’ll need more repositories to support this new code structure,&#8221; Sijbrandij said. &#8220;Basically, the more microservices you have the more repositories you’ll need. That is why it is not surprising that GitHub has announced free private repositories.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Sijbrandij referenced several examples where GitHub&#8217;s pricing changes hit open source organizations hard, including <a href=\"https://github.com/edx/\" target=\"_blank\">Open edX</a>, a non-profit with a large number of contributors, which <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11674530\" target=\"_blank\">posted</a> the following on Hacker News:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I work for a non-profit open source organization that <a href=\"https://github.com/edx/\" target=\"_blank\">collaborates on github</a>. We have lots of people who aren&#8217;t employees, but have signed a contributor agreement with our organization and contribute changes to our software. Our bill will go up from $200/month to over $2000/month with this new pricing. We can afford it (it&#8217;s still a small fraction of our AWS bill) but it will force us to look at other alternatives. Github&#8217;s code review tools are already pretty mediocre compared to other tools like gerrit, and we&#8217;ve long since moved off of GitHub issue tracking due to lack of features compared to JIRA.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Sijbrandij emphasized that the team at GitLab believes “everyone can contribute,” a mission which drives GitLab.com&#8217;s pricing structure to offer unlimited private repositories, unlimited contributors, and unlimited CI runners for free. The on-premises solution, which includes enterprise features and support, is what keeps the lights on at the company. GitLab.com, the free, hosted version, runs the same enterprise edition software but is, by Sijbrandij&#8217;s own admission, still <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/operations/issues/42\" target=\"_blank\">struggling with sluggish performance</a>.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year when open source project maintainers <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/open-source-project-maintainers-confront-github-with-open-letter-on-issue-management\" target=\"_blank\">confronted GitHub with an open letter on issue management</a>, GitLab differentiated itself by <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/gitlab-courts-open-source-project-maintainers-with-response-to-dear-github-letter\" target=\"_blank\">responding</a> to the situation with a new initiative focused on “making GitLab the best place for big open source projects.”</p>\n<p>Nearly a month later, <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/github-responds-to-letter-from-open-source-project-maintainers\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub finally responded</a> with an apology to open source project maintainers and a promise to address their concerns with a steady string of changes.</p>\n<p>GitHub has not given any indication of reversing its recent decision to change its pricing structure. However, with competitors like GitLab putting on the heat, GitHub may be forced to make some changes to its paid plans.

Mika Epstein, who helps review plugins before they&#8217;re added to the directory and is a dedicated support forum volunteer, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2016/05/03/handling-bad-reviews/\">gives advice </a>on how to handle and respond to bad reviews.</p>\n<p>Bad reviews are classified as those written as spam, trolling, emotional blackmail for support, and those that should have been a support post. Since the plugin review system is powered by bbPress, plugin authors can add tags to reviews in order to draw a moderator&#8217;s attention. The tags include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Modlook</strong> &#8211; This tag notifies moderators that a particular thread needs their attention. If you think a review is spam, don&#8217;t respond to it. Instead, add the Modlook and Spam tags and let a moderator decide if the review should be deleted.</li>\n<li><strong>Sockpuppet</strong> &#8211; If you suspect a review is part of a spamming campaign where a group of people are marking a plugin as one or five stars, apply the sockpuppet and modlook tags to the review.</li>\n<li><strong>Wrongplugin</strong> &#8211; Add the wrongplugin tag to the review if you believe it&#8217;s for a different plugin. The team can move the review to the appropriate place.</li>\n<li><strong>Pluginmod</strong> &#8211; Add this tag to a review if you need an administrator&#8217;s attention. This usually results in the team performing a full review of your plugin. If it&#8217;s determined that it breaks any of <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/about/guidelines/\">the guidelines</a>, it will be removed until they&#8217;re fixed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Developers who host plugins in the official directory should make note of these tags and use them when necessary. The tag system is generally unknown to the public but it&#8217;s a great way for moderators to keep on top of the forums and reviews.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 13 May 2016 01:06:02 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 234 – All Things WordCamp with Andrea Middleton\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:44:\"http://wptavern.com?p=54807&preview_id=54807\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"http://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-234-all-things-wordcamp-with-andrea-middleton\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2896:\"<p>In this episode of WordPress Weekly, Marcus Couch and I are joined by <a href=\"https://thethingwiththestuff.wordpress.com/\">Andrea Middleton</a>, who works at Automattic as a Community Organizer for the WordPress open source project.

All paid plans now include unlimited private repositories, but there&#8217;s a catch. The new pricing structure requires GitHub.com organizations to purchase a seat for each user. At $9 per user/month, collaborating on private repositories is now far more costly than the legacy plans which started at $25/month for 10 repositories and unlimited members.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/github-pricing.png\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/github-pricing.png?resize=1025%2C392\" alt=\"github-pricing\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-54756\" /></a></p>\n<p>The change is good news for individual developers with paid accounts, as they are no longer charged on a per-repository basis. However, many owners of organizations are finding the new pricing to be untenable and are actively considering alternatives. For comparison, Bitbucket offers unlimited private repositories and <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/product/pricing\" target=\"_blank\">charges $1/user/month</a>.

It&#8217;s their space and they provide a huge number of valuable tools. It is absolutely worth it.</p>\n<p>The problem I have is the drastic increase for existing customers. It&#8217;s largely the principal of increasing a customer&#8217;s cost by 2,276% without giving them any additional value.</p>\n<p>The value that Github provides me and my team does not change at all with the new pricing, only what I pay per month.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Samuel &#8220;Otto&#8221; Wood <a href=\"http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1solviv\" target=\"_blank\">contends</a> that GitHub&#8217;s $9/user/month is a reasonable price to pay for having all the functionality of GitHub hosted for an organization but that the alternative of building your own is far more economical.</p>\n<blockquote><p>A &#8220;private&#8221; repo is, you know, private. On your own server. Git is, after all, decentralized. You could plop a normal git repo on any private VPS you like in a matter of under an hour. If you&#8217;re collaborating with a small group of like 5 people, then coordination is not really a big deal that I&#8217;d pay $45 a month to use GitHub for it. You can use any tooling you like, make any website you like. You could probably reproduce the important parts of GitHub that you need for your private setup using WordPress in like a day or two. </p>\n<p>It just seems to me that any advantages of using GitHub at all seem largely nullified by using private repos. Yes, collaboration and using the same toolset you are used to, I get that. But here you&#8217;re falling prey to vendor lock-in once again. You&#8217;re used to it, you like it, you&#8217;re afraid of change, pay up. Simple. </p>\n<p>The advantage of open source software is the freedom to say &#8220;up yours&#8221; and build your own version instead. Git is open source. Think about it. A $15 a month VPS could easily fit your needs for both privacy and collaboration.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/github\">@github</a> found a way to be more expensive than the datacenter that runs my app. Seriously, what\'s happening at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/github\">@github</a> ???</p>\n<p>&mdash; Adilson Carvalho (@lcadilson) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lcadilson/status/730405070819471361\">May 11, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>GitHub has established itself as the de facto code collaboration site by offering free hosting for public, open source repositories. However, the emphasis on &#8220;social coding&#8221; no longer extends to private repositories as organization owners will have little incentive to add more collaborators under the new pricing structure. It discourages organizations from adding users to be bug reporters or third-party collaborators.

And while we&#8217;re currently not enforcing a timeline to move, rest assured that you&#8217;ll have at least 12 months notice before any mandated change to your plan.</p></blockquote>\n<p>While many individual developers will see lower monthly prices and even prorated credits on their accounts, the exponential cost increase for GitHub&#8217;s largest customers may cause a mass exodus to the company&#8217;s more affordable competitors.

This highly customizable, elegant theme was designed by <a href=\"http://carolinemoore.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Caroline Moore</a> with weddings and family announcements in mind.</p>\n<p>Affinity is a one-page theme with support for five different panels. Each panel&#8217;s content can be assigned in the customizer under Theme Options by selecting a page from a drop-down.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/panel.png\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/panel.png?resize=660%2C231\" alt=\"panel\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-54717\" /></a></p>\n<p>With the customizable panel approach users are not locked into providing content for sections they don&#8217;t need. Single posts and pages support full screen featured images that, if used as a panel, become the background of that section. Affinity offers the option to set the header image opacity to create better contrast with header text. Users can also enable or disable scrolling on the header and front-page featured images.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/affinity-home-page.png\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/affinity-home-page.png?resize=200%2C474\" alt=\"affinity-home-page\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-54693\" /></a></p>\n<p>Affinity includes support for a sidebar widget area and three optional widget areas in the footer. If widgets are added to the sidebar, the one-column layout becomes a two-column layout. It also has a fullwidth page template for removing the sidebar on select pages.</p>\n<p>The different panels give users ample space for adding photos, links to registries, personal stories, info about the bridal party, and anything else related to the event. Affinity includes a Guestbook page template with a special format for displaying visitors&#8217; comments. Turning the Guestbook on is as easy as setting the page template and making sure that comments are enabled.</p>\n<p>Another unique feature of the theme is its post intro area that displays beneath the headline before the first paragraph. It pulls content from the excerpt field and post authors can use it to capture readers&#8217; attention with a quick summary or highlight.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/affinity-post-intro.png\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/affinity-post-intro.png?resize=660%2C328\" alt=\"affinity-post-intro\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-54729\" /></a></p>\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://affinitydemo.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">live demo</a> to see the theme in action. It shows an example of panels that display quotes, an RSVP form, event details, and an engagement story.</p>\n<p>Since no wedding or family announcement is the same, Affinity&#8217;s multi-panel approach offers flexibility for many different types of uses. If you&#8217;re creating a wedding website and are not finding enough customization options with a hosted service, this theme makes it quick and easy to set it up with WordPress. It&#8217;s not yet available on WordPress.org, but you can download a copy for your self-hosted site for free from the sidebar of its <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/themes/affinity\" target=\"_blank\">homepage on WordPress.com</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 11 May 2016 06:52:35 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"WPTavern: Help WPCampus Gather Data on How Schools and Campuses Use WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=54650\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:87:\"http://wptavern.com/help-wpcampus-gather-data-on-how-schools-and-campuses-use-wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1247:\"<p>The organizers of <a href=\"https://2016.wpcampus.org/\">WPCampus</a> are <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/wpcampus05-2016\">seeking feedback</a> via a survey on how schools and campuses utilize WordPress in their environments.

We recently learned of https://woogpl.com, which actively makes use of our registered trademarks in both its name and promotion. We are very concerned that your use of Woo and WooCommerce will create confusion by communicating that your WooCommerce products are endorsed by or associated with Automattic, when in fact it is not.</p>\n<p>While Automattic appreciates that you are providing products that build on WooCommerce open source software, that fact does not authorize you to use Woo, WooThemes or WooCommerce trademarks.</p>\n<p>To minimize user confusion and to protect our own intellectual property, we unfortunately must insist that you take prompt steps to change your domain name to something that doesn’t include &#8216;Woo&#8217; in the prefix, and change your product descriptions to avoid confusion and potentially misleading consumers to believe they are purchasing our products. An example of this would be: WooCommerce Email Customiser Pro would need to be changed to Email Customiser Pro for WooCommerce.</p>\n<p>For more information, please see our <a href=\"https://www.woothemes.com/style-guide/#sg-trademarks\">Trademark Guidelines</a>.</p>\n<p>While we are appreciative that you have included a disclaimer on your site, unfortunately this would not be sufficient and we would still insist that the domain name and product names be changed.</p></blockquote>\n<p>While it&#8217;s not the sole reason <a href=\"https://woogpl.com/woogpl-is-closing/\">WooGPL is shutting down</a>, the notice provides a convenient opportunity to rebrand to <a href=\"https://www.gplkit.com/\">GPL Kit</a>, something the company was already planning to do.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We would have eventually closed down WooGPL due to GPL Kit however, it would have been great to close it down on our terms when the time was right,&#8221; Daniel, who is part of the GPL Kit team told the Tavern.</p>\n<p>Daniel says that when he started WooGPL there wasn&#8217;t a trademark registered with the Woo character mark until October of 2015.</p>\n<p>A search of the United States Patent and Trademark Office for Woo contains over 1K results.

While I didn&#8217;t receive a response from WooRockets, John Gamour of WooAssist provided the Tavern with the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote><p>No, we haven&#8217;t been contacted by Automattic about that. It would be dissapointing if we were asked to change our name as our founder Nicholas Jones reached out to WooThemes before starting Wooassist and they gave the OK. We have also worked with Matt Cohen and James Koster on a project and nothing was ever mentioned about our name.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I tried to get in touch with Paul Sieminski, legal counsel for Automattic, to learn what the criteria is for violating the trademarks, who&#8217;s at risk, and how long they have enforced the marks but he could not be reached for comment.</p>\n<h2>Better to be Safe Than Sorry</h2>\n<p>As WooGPL discovered, adding a disclaimer to the bottom of your sites may not be enough. Considering the cost and potential impacts of re branding a company or product, it&#8217;s important to know as soon as possible if you&#8217;re infringing a company&#8217;s trademarks.</p>\n<p>Business owners in the WooCommerce and WooThemes ecosystem should double-check the <a href=\"https://www.woothemes.com/style-guide/#sg-trademarks\">style guide</a> to make sure you&#8217;re not violating any guidelines.

To keep pace with the expectations of mobile buyers, WooCommerce has drastically reduced Storefront&#8217;s mobile header height by 60% and has added the search, shopping cart, and account links to a sticky bottom menu for easy access.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/storefront-mobile-home.png\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/storefront-mobile-home.png?resize=799%2C697\" alt=\"storefront-mobile-home\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-54671\" /></a></p>\n<p>Storefront 2.0 includes many design improvements that make the theme cleaner and more flexible. This update removes Helvetica in favor of Source Sans, which WooCommerce says gives them access to a wider variety of weights they can use to &#8220;provide greater depth and cohesion.&#8221; Other notable design changes include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Borders have been largely removed so that pages don’t feel quite so broken up.</li>\n<li>The breadcrumb and the main navigation are now wrapped in their own content regions, cementing them as unique components.</li>\n<li>Product reviews and comments tweaked to make them cleaner and more scannable.</li>\n<li>Blog post meta has been redesigned to include the author Gravatar.</li>\n<li>Softer design treatment for tables with colors based on the main background color.</li>\n<li>oEmbeds have been styled to match the rest of Storefront (including typography, padding, colors).</li>\n<li>Integrated WordPress 4.5’s custom logo feature so users can add a logo without using a plugin.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/storefront/\" target=\"_blank\">Storefront</a> is active on more than 50,000 websites.

The plugin is active on more than 10,000 websites where theme authors have elected to keep PHP files separate from HTML. Timber is built on DRY and MVC principles to solve the problem stated in its unofficial tagline: <em>&#8220;Because WordPress is awesome, but the_loop isn&#8217;t.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Over the past four years, the open source project has evolved from being a starter theme to a plugin that can be added to existing themes. It is now used on <a href=\"http://upstatement.com/timber/#showcase\" target=\"_blank\">thousands of websites</a> and has 83 <a href=\"https://github.com/timber/timber/graphs/contributors\" target=\"_blank\">contributors</a> listed on GitHub.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In 2012 I was getting more into WordPress after doing lots of JS development with <a href=\"http://handlebarsjs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Handlebars</a> (a JS templating language),&#8221; Timber creator Jared Novack said. &#8220;I went to WordCamp Providence to learn more about state-of-the-art WordPress ways. I remember thinking: &#8216;This is great, but I really miss the cleanliness of Handlebars &#8212; I wish someone would make something like that for WordPress.&#8217; That&#8217;s when I realized, I was that someone.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Novack was playing around with <a href=\"http://www.smarty.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Smarty</a> and <a href=\"https://mustache.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Mustache</a> before he finally discovered Fabien Potencier&#8217;s <a href=\"http://twig.sensiolabs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Twig project</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The syntax felt so natural I almost didn&#8217;t need to read the docs (don&#8217;t worry, I did),&#8221; he said. &#8220;I realized what I needed was a way to marry Twig and WordPress, and thus: Timber was born.&#8221;</p>\n<p>At that time Novack&#8217;s company, <a href=\"https://upstatement.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Upstatement</a>, was beginning development on a big new project for Random House to enable their marketers to generate unique sites from a library of templates. This client project became Timber&#8217;s first test case.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Originally, Timber was a parent theme, like _s. But after we completed the Random House project, I realized I wanted to apply Timber functionality to existing sites,&#8221; Novack said. &#8220;I converted it into a plugin that could be employed on existing themes which is the form it takes today.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The plugin allows designers skilled with HTML and CSS to create themes without having extensive knowledge of PHP and WordPress functions. Timber successfully powers sites like Michael Bloomberg&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.thetrace.org/\" target=\"_blank\">The Trace</a>, <a href=\"http://everytown.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Everytown for Gun Safety</a>, <a href=\"https://www.hoteltonight.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Hotel Tonight</a>, and the <a href=\"http://harvardlawreview.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Harvard Law Review</a>.</p>\n<h3>Timber 1.0 Puts the Project on the Path of Stability</h3>\n<p>As of Timber 1.0, developers can now include the project as a plugin or require it as a <a href=\"https://packagist.org/packages/timber/timber\" target=\"_blank\">Composer dependency</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The big news is that 1.0 represents a maturing of the platform — developers can use Timber and Twig with confidence that they’re building on top of a stable and universal platform,&#8221; Novack said.</p>\n<p>This release sheds years of deprecated functions and methods dating back to the project&#8217;s early days in 2013. Novack said that technical and documentation debt were the biggest hurdles in getting to 1.0.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In hindsight it’s so easy to build stuff, but so hard to build a complete system,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When Timber started it was just for me and the documentation could just live in my head. I’d add and improve stuff and then live with some of the quirks.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As the project and its contributors grew, Novack found it difficult to keep up with the growing codebase while running his company. Bringing it to a place of maturity with up-to-date automated testing and documentation took nearly a year.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Backwards compatibility was also a major challenge,&#8221; Novack said. &#8220;As ideas and new code got submitted, development slowed as every decision might have implications for existing users. We would deprecate features, but I was hesitant to remove things that I knew were mistakes, but that people were using.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Developers are encouraged to read the <a href=\"https://github.com/timber/timber/wiki/1.0-Upgrade-Guide\" target=\"_blank\">1.0 Upgrade Guide</a>, as there may be additional steps required depending on how Timber is being used. This release adds a few new features but the most important change is the bulk removal of older sections of the codebase. The upgrade guide outlines all of the object properties and static methods that will need to be updated so that nothing breaks. In the future, Timber-powered themes will be easier to maintain, with fewer quirks and better-documented features.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The key learning for me is that the ultimate &#8216;killer feature&#8217; is stability and predictability,&#8221; Novack said. &#8220;When everything is organized cleanly and developers can use the things that they would intuitively expect — that’s success.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 09 May 2016 17:52:38 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:49:\"Post Status: WordPress Security — Draft podcast\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=24378\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-security-draft-podcast/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2296:\"<p>Welcome to the Post Status <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/category/draft\">Draft podcast</a>, which you can find <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008\">on iTunes</a>, <a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast\">Stitcher</a>, and <a href=\"http://simplecast.fm/podcasts/1061/rss\">via RSS</a> for your favorite podcatcher.

Creators Borek Bernard and Jan Voráček, who originally attempted to crowdfund the project and then <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/versionpress-raises-400k-in-seed-funding\" target=\"_blank\">raised $400,000 in seed funding</a>, <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/versionpress-transitions-into-a-free-open-source-project\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> last month that they are transitioning to a public development model.</p>\n<p>The team&#8217;s goal with this release was to polish up the experience of using VersionPress in the default WordPress installation while adding more useful features. However, it is not yet ready for use in production, according to Bernard.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We’re still keeping VersionPress in the <a href=\"http://docs.versionpress.net/en/getting-started/about-eap\" target=\"_blank\">“early access” period</a>, because of the third party plugins integration story but on simpler sites, VersionPress already shines,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>One of the most notable new features in VersionPress 3.0 is the plugin&#8217;s ability to track commits with the environment where they were created. Users can view changes in the admin and easily see if they were pushed to the staging or production environment.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/commit-tracking-in-environment.gif\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/commit-tracking-in-environment.gif?resize=725%2C347\" alt=\"commit-tracking-in-environment\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-54599\" /></a></p>\n<p>Version 3.0 also adds searching capabilities for filtering commits by author, date, commit message, and WordPress action. This release also includes a new bulk undo feature for commits and many improvements to the core versioning engine.</p>\n<h3>VersionPress 4.0 to Focus on Support for 3rd Party Plugins</h3>\n<p>One of the reasons the VersionPress team decided to go with a public development model was to mitigate the plugin&#8217;s conflicts with third-party themes and plugins. This was only possible if the opened up the codebase for contribution from other developers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;While we had most of the WordPress core covered pretty well, there was still this huge ecosystem of WordPress plugins and themes that could cause trouble to VersionPress in million different ways,&#8221; Borek said. &#8220;In the long run, the project had to turn into OSS should it be successful, and, fortunately, we met investors who understood this and supported our vision.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Borek and the team plan to focus on adding support for complex third party plugins in version 4.0, tentatively scheduled for mid-2016. One commenter on the post mentioned that a lack of WooCommerce support is a major thing holding him back from using VersionPress on projects. Borek confirmed that WooCommerce is high on their list of plugins they want to support.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our goal remains the same: to take all the incredibly powerful functionality of Git and package it so that every WordPress user can use it,&#8221; Borek said.</p>\n<p>Since most site owners interested in this plugin are not running vanilla installations of WordPress, support for third party plugins will be a major leap forward for the project with the potential to greatly expand its user base.

It uses just 7mb of RAM, because it doesn&#8217;t include Vagrant, Apache, Nginx, or a /etc/hosts file. Here&#8217;s how it works:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Laravel Valet configures your Mac to always run PHP&#8217;s built-in web server in the background when your machine starts. Then, using DnsMasq, Valet proxies all requests on the *.dev domain to point to sites installed on your local machine.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Valet supports Laravel, Lumen, Statamic, Craft, Jigsaw, and even has a driver for WordPress. It&#8217;s handy if you just need a simple, fast development environment without virtualization. Developers can also share sites publicly via local tunnels. It&#8217;s as easy as navigating to the site&#8217;s directory in the terminal and running the <code>valet share</code> command, which generates a publicly accessible URL.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wppusher.com/\" target=\"_blank\">WP Pusher</a> founder Peter Suhm, who is active in both the Laravel and WordPress communities, wrote a <a href=\"http://blog.wppusher.com/a-minimalist-development-environment-for-wordpress-with-laravel-valet/\" target=\"_blank\">tutorial</a> for setting up Valet for WordPress development.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For larger apps, I generally prefer my development environment to be very similar to production,&#8221; Suhm said. &#8220;Vagrant and Docker are great for that. Valet is great for all those quick and dirty WordPress installations you need, just to test something or quickly work on an idea. If you don’t need anything else besides PHP 7 and a database, Valet is a great setup.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Since it doesn&#8217;t require a ton of dependencies, Valet is quick to set up and doesn&#8217;t require any configuration.

Open Sans, which loads from Google Fonts as an external resource, has been in use in the admin since 2013.</p>\n<p>&#8220;At the time of introduction in 3.8, there were not good system fonts common to all platforms at the time,&#8221; WordPress lead developer <a href=\"http://helenhousandi.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Helen Hou-Sandí</a> said in her <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/37361\" target=\"_blank\">commit</a> message. &#8220;In the years since, Windows, Android, OS X, iOS, Firefox OS, and various flavors of Linux have all gotten their own (good) system UI fonts.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Now that the admin doesn&#8217;t have to load fonts from Google, it should feel faster and will provide a better experience for developers who are working offline.</p>\n<p>Dropping Open Sans originated as part of the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/features/font-natively/\" target=\"_blank\">Font Natively</a> feature project led by WordPress designer <a href=\"https://mattmiklic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Matt Miklic</a>, Mark Uraine, and Helen Hou-Sandí. The project page provides screenshots for the WP admin with Open Sans in Firefox on OSX vs the admin with system fonts, but the team noted that they are in need of more screenshots from different environments.</p>\n<p>Anytime that WordPress can shed a third-party dependency while improving the experience in the admin is a win for everyone. The commit comes early in the release cycle in order to get more people testing for misalignments and any other issues.

Wordfence <a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2016/05/ninja-forms-shell-upload-vulnerability-high-risk/\">is reporting</a> that Ninja Forms versions 2.9.36 to 2.9.42 contain multiple security vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>One of the vulnerabilities allows an attacker to upload and execute code remotely on WordPress sites. The only information needed to exploit the vulnerability is the URL of the target site that&#8217;s using a form powered by an affected version of Ninja Forms.</p>\n<p>Kevin Stover, CTO of Ninja Forms, explains to the Tavern how they discovered the vulnerabilities:</p>\n<blockquote><p>About two weeks ago, we were contacted by a security researcher, James Golovich, regarding a file upload issue within Ninja Forms. He demonstrated that it was possible to upload an arbitrary file using some test code that hadn’t been removed during our build process.</p>\n<p>We realised that the test code had accidentally been utilised in other areas of the plugin, and we immediately began working on a fix. While the issue was being patched, we reached out to the devs at the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">WordPress.org</a> repo and began the processes of preparing for auto updating users of the affected versions.</p>\n<p>Once the patch had been tested, we pushed version 2.9.43 and .1 versions of 2.9.36 &#8211; 2.9.42. Shortly after, <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">WordPress.org</a> began pushing out automatic updates.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As to why there wasn&#8217;t a post published immediately on the official <a href=\"https://ninjaforms.com/blog/\">Ninja Forms blog</a> announcing the update, &#8220;We didn’t want to go public with the vulnerability until our users had time to update, both to the newest version and the .1 versions,&#8221; Stover said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;James Golovich&#8217;s responsible disclosure gave us time to fix the issue and for our users to update to safe versions before disclosing the vulnerability on his site,&#8221; he said. The company has since <a href=\"https://ninjaforms.com/important-security-update-always-hurt-ones-love/\">published a blog post </a>concerning the update.</p>\n<p>Working with the WordPress security team, automatic updates started rolling out on Tuesday, May 3rd. If automatic plugin updates are disabled, you&#8217;re highly encouraged to update manually to 2.9.45 as soon as possible. The Ninja Forms team is also working with a number of large webhosts to ensure as many sites as possible are updated.</p>\n<p>Wordfence is not detecting wide-spread exploitation but this could change in the next few days as details of the exploit emerge.</p>\n<p>When it comes to security vulnerabilities, the ability to upload and execute code remotely is about as severe as it gets. Golovich is credited with <a href=\"http://www.pritect.net/blog/ninja-forms-2-9-42-critical-security-vulnerabilities\">responsibly disclosing</a> the vulnerability to the Ninja Forms team. He also provides technical details of each vulnerability, most of which are in the Ninja Forms 3.0 code base.</p>\n<p>According to Golovich, the most vulnerable code is a proof of concept:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The following vulnerable code was, according to Kyle Johnson of the WP Ninjas team &#8216;not a live feature of Ninja Forms, but was more of a proof of concept for a future free feature.&#8217; Unfortunately, even proof of concept code that is accessible is still vulnerable to attack. This is the most critical vulnerability here because it potentially allows an attacker to execute arbitrary php code on a site.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Users should update as soon as possible as it&#8217;s only a matter of time before tools are created that can easily take advantage of the exploit.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 05 May 2016 20:46:19 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"WPTavern: WordPress.org Support Forums Adds Accessibility Section\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=54472\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-support-forums-adds-accessibility-section\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3619:\"<p>Earlier this year, the WordPress project made a huge move by <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-adopts-accessibility-coding-standards-for-all-new-and-updated-code\">adopting accessibility coding standards</a> for new and updated code.

Many of the support queries come through email or direct messages to individuals on the team. The forum enables everyone to participate in the support process.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If people ask their questions publicly, I or others not necessarily on the Accessibility Team can answer, and the answers are then public,&#8221; Rush said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have a pattern library on GitHub, which we all contribute to when we have time. But there are all kinds of solutions being passed around on Twitter and spread across other people&#8217;s GitHub accounts. So if someone asks a question like that, we can either point to something in specific cases, which is most of them, there&#8217;s probably already a specific solution that someone&#8217;s built, and we can link to that,&#8221; Rush told the Tavern.</p>\n<p>The accessibility support forum also comes with a side benefit, &#8220;W<span class=\"message_body\">e don&#8217;t have to say no all the time when people ask for support, or what looks like all the time to some people. Everyone can help each other </span><span class=\"message_body\">out and Google has a public resource,&#8221; Rush said.<br />\n</span></p>\n<p>The support forum comes at a time where accessibility is an increasingly important part of web development. For example, the European Union <a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-1654_en.htm\">recently agreed to new rules</a> that will make public sector websites and apps more accessible.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions related to accessibility, you can post them on the forum.

Developers can now add a single line of code to bring the icons and CSS toolkit into their projects.</p>\n<p>The icon files and CSS are hosted by <a href=\"https://www.maxcdn.com/\" target=\"_blank\">MaxCDN</a>, which serves a cached version that loads quickly on websites that use Font Awesome. The CDN uses <a href=\"https://github.com/typekit/webfontloader\" target=\"_blank\">Web Font Loader</a>, which was co-developed by Google and Typekit, to load the icons asynchronously. This also gives developers <a href=\"https://github.com/typekit/webfontloader#events\" target=\"_blank\">CSS and JavaScript events</a> to hook into on loading.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/font-awesome-4-6-0-adds-new-accessibility-icons-category\" target=\"_blank\">FontAwesome 4.6 added a new accessibility icon category</a> and the new CDN helps to automate outputting the correct markup. If the icon you&#8217;re using has semantic meaning, including an accurate title attribute with the inline icon will trigger Font Awesome&#8217;s JS to do the rest.</p>\n<p>Font Awesome requires an email address from those want to use the CDN so it can issue a unique embed code for each. Developers also have the option to register a Font Awesome CDN account to keep track of sites and apps where they are using the icons, and manage multiple embed codes. Once logged in, you can enable or disable auto-accessibility, asynchronous icon loading, easy updates to newer Font Awesome versions, and CSS or JS embed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/font-awesome-account.png\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/font-awesome-account.png?resize=1025%2C865\" alt=\"font-awesome-account\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-54543\" /></a></p>\n<p>One of the most convenient reasons to use the CDN is to simplify updates. WordPress plugin and theme developers do not have to bump versions or push any code to use the latest version. Font Awesome version changes can be triggered on an individual basis for each embed code in a developer&#8217;s account dashboard.

The event was organized by Ryan Erwin and a <a href=\"https://2016.chicago.wordcamp.org/organizers/\">team of volunteers. </a></p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/JJJWCChicago2016.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-54500\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/JJJWCChicago2016.jpg?resize=1024%2C768\" alt=\"John James Jacoby talking about bbPress and BuddyPress\" /></a>John James Jacoby talking about bbPress and BuddyPress\n<p>Tracks were split up into three separate rooms limiting the amount of background noise during sessions. Giving attendees a schedule is handled differently at most camps. Some provide a paper schedule while others put it on the back of the name badge.</p>\n<p>At WordCamp Chicago, schedule boards were displayed outside each room that corresponded with a track number. This made it easier for attendees to determine if they wanted to stay in the room for the next session.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/WCChicago2016Schedule.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-54501\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/WCChicago2016Schedule.jpg?resize=1024%2C1365\" alt=\"Schedule Board Outside The Room Hosting Track 1\" /></a>Schedule Board Outside The Room Hosting Track 1\n<p>WordCamps are a great way to stress test a venue&#8217;s network but the WiFi at WordCamp Chicago was flawless. I didn&#8217;t experience any issues and it remained fast throughout the event. I didn&#8217;t stick around for lunch as there are plenty of lunch options available within walking distance of the venue.</p>\n<h2>The After Party</h2>\n<p>Most WordCamps host an after party at a restaurant, bar, or other establishment away from the venue. WordCamp Chicago&#8217;s after party was held at the venue. It included, non-alcoholic and alcoholic drinks, food, and card games on each table. It was fun mingling and networking with people without having to compete with blaring music or a loud atmosphere.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/WCChicago2016AfterParty.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-54503\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/WCChicago2016AfterParty.jpg?resize=1024%2C768\" alt=\"WordCamp Chicago 2016 After Party\" /></a>WordCamp Chicago 2016 After Party\n<p>Out of all the sessions I attended, my favorite is <a href=\"https://2016.chicago.wordcamp.org/session/disastrous-deals-to-profitable-projects-comparing-my-best-and-worst-client-experiences/\">by Kyle Maurer,</a> who shared experiences and advice from <a href=\"http://realbigmarketing.com/\">building client websites</a> over the years.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest pieces of advice he shared is to build direct relationships with clients. No one is going to fight your battles as much as you and third-parties are unlikely to stick their neck out. Managing direct relationships leads to trust, referrals, and being rehired to do additional work.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/KyleMaurerSlideWCChicago2016.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-54504\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/KyleMaurerSlideWCChicago2016.jpg?resize=1024%2C768\" alt=\"A Slide from Kyle Maurer\'s Presentation\" /></a>A Slide from Kyle Maurer&#8217;s Presentation\n<p>His session contains a lot of great information and I highly encourage you to watch it when it&#8217;s published on WordPress.tv.</p>\n<h2>WordCamps Offer a Lot of Value For The Price</h2>\n<p>Throughout the event, I spoke to a number of people and noted the following. Many attendees said they received more value than expected paying $40 a ticket. Some have spent hundreds of dollars on conference tickets and didn&#8217;t enjoy themselves or come away with nearly as much information.</p>\n<p>I discovered a number of attendees are part of one or more WordPress meetup groups. According to Meetup.com, there are at least <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/find/?allMeetups=false&keywords=Chicago+WordPress&radius=25&userFreeform=chicago+I&mcId=c60601&change=yes&sort=recommended&eventFilter=mysugg\">four WordPress groups </a>with hundreds of members spread throughout the Chicago area. It&#8217;s a strong indication that the WordPress community in Chicago is thriving and supportive of each other.</p>\n<h2>WordCamp Chicago in 2017</h2>\n<p>It was a pleasure attending WordCamp Chicago and making new friends. I especially enjoyed speaking to WordPress Weekly listeners and getting their feedback. Also for those wondering, I satisfied my craving for deep-dish pizza via <a href=\"http://www.loumalnatis.com/arizona-phoenix\">Lou Malnati&#8217;s</a>. The pizza tastes better than I remembered. If you&#8217;re ever in the Chicago area, you have to try Lou Malnati&#8217;s pizza.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/TheLou.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-54505\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/TheLou.jpg?resize=1024%2C768\" alt=\"The Lou!\" /></a>The Lou!\n<p>Everyone involved with WordCamp Chicago 2016 did a great job. If you didn&#8217;t get a chance to attend this year, don&#8217;t worry. After taking a break for a few weeks, the organizing team plans to begin organizing WordCamp Chicago 2017.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 05 May 2016 03:00:06 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"WPTavern: Automattic Introduces WooCommerce Connect, Hosted Components for E-Commerce\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=54476\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:94:\"http://wptavern.com/automattic-introduces-woocommerce-connect-hosted-components-for-e-commerce\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5426:\"<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/woocommerce-logo.png\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/woocommerce-logo.png?resize=1025%2C466\" alt=\"woocommerce-logo\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-54492\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.woothemes.com/woocommerce/\" target=\"_blank\">WooCommerce</a> is the current leader in e-commerce software, capturing <a href=\"https://wappalyzer.com/categories/ecommerce\" target=\"_blank\">31% of the market</a>, thanks to its relatively user-friendly interface and connection to WordPress. However, setting up a WooCommerce site, or any e-commerce site for that matter, is not for the faint of heart, no matter how user-friendly the software. It requires knowledge of hosting, PCI compliance, payment gateways, SSL certificates, shipping methods, tax, and more.</p>\n<p>When <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/automattic-acquires-woocommerce\" target=\"_blank\">Automattic acquired WooCommerce</a> last May, the company accepted the challenge to make it as easy to create stores online as WordPress.com has done for websites.</p>\n<p>“I believe that the web needs an open, independent and easy-to-use commerce platform that you can run yourself on your own website,” Matt Mullenweg said in his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJOfTB8-daA\" target=\"_blank\">video</a> announcement of the acquisition.</p>\n<p>Automattic has been working to simplify selling with WooCommerce and today the company announced <a href=\"https://www.woothemes.com/2016/05/woocommerce-connect-announcement/\" target=\"_blank\">WooCommerce Connect</a>, the secret project that Mullenweg <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WooConf/status/717725650916741120\" target=\"_blank\">hinted</a> at during WooConf.</p>\n<p>WC Connect is WooCommerce&#8217;s new Automattic-hosted SaaS architecture that was created to offer store features in a more user-friendly way. It is built on the WP REST API and offers a simplified Calypso-style interface for configuring options.</p>\n<p>The first service offered via the alpha version of WC Connect is real-time USPS shipping rates for US-based stores. It eliminates the need for a USPS API key as well as a subscription key from WooCommerce. One of the advantages for the user is that there are fewer software updates to install for extensions, as all the code is maintained on Automattic&#8217;s servers.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/usps-wc-connect.png\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/usps-wc-connect.png?resize=650%2C362\" alt=\"usps-wc-connect\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-54493\" /></a></p>\n<h3>What&#8217;s Next for WooCommerce Connect?</h3>\n<p>If the testing goes well, WooCommerce plans to roll Connect into the plugin&#8217;s core to make it easier to serve more hosted e-commerce components. The team is also working on expanding shipping options for the beta.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In the near future we hope to integrate with further shipping services, most likely Canada Post next,&#8221; said WooThemes co-founder <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mark_forrester\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Forrester</a>. &#8220;Shipping and payment options seem the logical place for us to start.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Forrester confirmed that while the USPS shipping method is free, WooThemes is exploring monetizing other service offerings in the future. If WC Connect has a successful beta period, the team will consider using the same model for offering payment gateways in the future.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Setting up payments for your store should be simple and behind the scenes,&#8221; Forrester said. &#8220;We believe we can offer better options for our customers working closely with payment partners and using connected services.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Forrester said that the team hopes WC Connect can be baked into WooCommerce core soon, but they will make the decision based on user feedback from the alpha/beta period.</p>\n<p>Those who create WooCommerce extensions and depend on its ecosystem may be wondering whether the SaaS model will overtake the plugin entirely. Last May, during his WooCommerce Q&amp;A, Matt Mullenweg <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2015/05/woomattic/#comment-583541\" target=\"_blank\">confirmed</a> that Automattic is not moving towards a 100% SaaS model.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If or when we do SAAS, the plugin isn’t going away, it’ll continue as it has,&#8221; Mullenweg said.</p>\n<p>WooCommerce is not being rolled into Jetpack, as many suspected when Automattic acquired the product. However, WC Connect does require users to connect to WordPress.com via Jetpack.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We feel it makes sense to leverage the code/infrastructure of one of the most powerful WordPress connected services,&#8221; Forrester said.</p>\n<p>The team is aiming to make WC Connect a simpler way to connect services to online stores without users having to leave their WooCommerce dashboards. Many store owners would rather pay for hosted software they don&#8217;t have to update as opposed to self-hosted extensions that require regular maintenance.</p>\n<p>If the strategy of offering hosted e-commmerce components succeeds at making store management easier for non-developers, Automattic will be able to profit from offering compelling commercial WC Connect services, such as payment gateways, and expand WooCommerce&#8217;s global reach.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 04 May 2016 22:20:21 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";a:10:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Mon, 06 Jun 2016 08:40:57 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:8:\"text/xml\";s:14:\"content-length\";s:6:\"228016\";s:10:\"connection\";s:5:\"close\";s:4:\"vary\";s:15:\"Accept-Encoding\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Mon, 06 Jun 2016 08:30:18 GMT\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:11:\"HIT lax 250\";s:13:\"accept-ranges\";s:5:\"bytes\";}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20130911040210\";}','no'),(8492,'_transient_timeout_feed_mod_d117b5738fbd35bd8c0391cda1f2b5d9','1465245658','no'),(8493,'_transient_feed_mod_d117b5738fbd35bd8c0391cda1f2b5d9','1465202458','no'),(8494,'_transient_timeout_feed_b9388c83948825c1edaef0d856b7b109','1465245658','no'),(8495,'_transient_feed_b9388c83948825c1edaef0d856b7b109','a:4:{s:5:\"child\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:3:\"rss\";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:7:\"version\";s:3:\"2.0\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:7:\"channel\";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:117:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n	\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"WordPress Plugins » View: Popular\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/browse/popular/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"WordPress Plugins » View: Popular\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"language\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"en-US\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 06 Jun 2016 08:18:29 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:9:\"generator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"http://bbpress.org/?v=1.1\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"item\";a:30:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"\n			\n			\n			\n			\n			\n			\n					\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"WooCommerce\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/#post-29860\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 05 Sep 2011 08:13:36 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:36:\"29860@https://wordpress.org/plugins/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:97:\"WooCommerce is a powerful, extendable eCommerce plugin that helps you sell anything.

However when I went to print it, it came out all crappy.  For some reason these things never print right. <br />\n<br /> So I got to thinking wouldn\'t it be cool if you could output this documentation in flashpaper, since that\'s one of the features of Blackstone.  Then I took a look at the url for the documentation, I noticed that the renderer for the cfc documentation was a cfc named \"cfcexplorer.cfc,\" and the documentation was created using the \"getcfcinhtml\" mehtod. Since the cfc was installed on myserver I opend it up and saw this:<br/>\n<br />\n<div class=\"code\">\n &lt;cffunction name=\"getcfcinhtml\" access=\"remote\"\nhint=\"Generates html descriptor of a component with the specified name or URI path as the http response.\"&gt;\n&lt;cfargument name=\"name\" type=\"string\" required=\"yes\" /&gt;\n&lt;cfargument name=\"path\" type=\"string\" required=\"no\" /&gt;\n\n&lt;cftry&gt;\n&lt;cfscript&gt;\nif ( IsDefined(\'arguments.path\') and arguments.path neq \'\' ) {\nproxy = CreateObject( \"java\", \"coldfusion.runtime.TemplateProxyFactory\" ) ;\ncomp = proxy.ResolvePath( arguments.path, getPageContext() ) ;\n} else {\ncomp = CreateObject( \"component\", name ) ;\n}\n\nutils = CreateObject( \"component\", \"utils\" ) ;\nWriteOutput( utils.cfcToHTML(comp) ) ;\n&lt;/cfscript&gt;\n&lt;cfcatch type=\"coldfusion.runtime.CfJspPage$NoSuchTemplateException\"&gt;\n&lt;cfoutput&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Component not found&lt;/h4&gt;\nThe component definition file for component \'#name#\' cannot be found on this server.&lt;/cfoutput&gt;\n&lt;/cfcatch&gt;\n&lt;/cftry&gt;\n&lt;/cffunction&gt;\n</div>\n\n<br />\nSo I got to thinking, couldn\'t I just wrap the whole thing in a &lt;cfdocument&gt; tag.  I tried it, and it worked. <br />\n<br />\n\n<div class=\"code\">\n&lt;cffunction name=\"getcfcinfp\" access=\"remote\"\nhint=\"Generates flashpaper descriptor of a component with the specified name or URI path as the http response.\"&gt;\n&lt;cfargument name=\"name\" type=\"string\" required=\"yes\" /&gt;\n&lt;cfargument name=\"path\" type=\"string\" required=\"no\" /&gt;\n\n&lt;cftry&gt;\n&lt;cfdocument format=\"flashpaper\"&gt;\n\n&lt;cfscript&gt; if ( IsDefined(\'arguments.path\') and arguments.path neq \'\' ) {\nproxy = CreateObject( \"java\", \"coldfusion.runtime.TemplateProxyFactory\" ) ;\ncomp = proxy.ResolvePath( arguments.path, getPageContext() ) ;\n} else {\ncomp = CreateObject( \"component\", name ) ;\n}\n\nutils = CreateObject( \"component\", \"utils\" ) ;\nWriteOutput( utils.cfcToHTML(comp) ) ;\n&lt;/cfscript&gt;\n\n&lt;/cfdocument&gt;\n&lt;cfcatch type=\"coldfusion.runtime.CfJspPage$NoSuchTemplateException\"&gt;\n&lt;cfoutput&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Component not found&lt;/h4&gt;\nThe component definition file for component \'#name#\' cannot be found on this server.&lt;/cfoutput&gt;\n&lt;/cfcatch&gt;\n\n&lt;/cftry&gt;\n&lt;/cffunction&gt;\n</div>\n<br />\nOnce that\'s done, all you have to do is change the method called in the URL when you browse your cfc from \"cfcexplorer.cfc?method=getcfcinhtml\" to \"cfcexplorer.cfc?method=getcfcinfp\"<br /><br />\nCool huh?

One of the things I think is really cool about <a href=\"http://www.macromedia.com/software/coldfusion/\">Cold Fusion 7</a> is the fact that it can dynamically create <a href=\"http://www.macromedia.com/software/flashpaper/\">Flashpaper</a> by way of &lt;cfdocument&gt;.  I think there are two big advantages to using Flashpaper over PDF\'s in web applications: 1. Since they\'re just .swf files, they load much faster; 2. Since they load faster you can embed them in pages. However when you use &lt;cfdocument&gt; the existing website interface is completely replaced by Flashpaper\'s interface. I believe there are some cases when you wouldn\'t want that. According, I have written a cfc that will allow you to pass content in and embed &lt;cfdocument&gt; created Flashpaper in line.\n\nCheck it out: <a href=\"http://www.numtopia.com/terry/code_flashpaper_embedder.cfm\">Flashpaper Embedder</a>.

Under their new fix, I did not have to involve my hosting provider. They gave me a customized Bootstrap.pm, and required me to create an IIS virtual directory. It was a much more elegant solution than the one they gave me on the first try, and it actualy worked, so that was pretty cool.

I would avoid this class. There used to be a great white paper from Macromedia about securing CF7, but I can\'t find it now. I\'m sure it address the most common problems with ColdFusion servers, that is that the OS is poorly secured, but I was looking for more than just how to filter packets.\n\nThe keynote was good but not really explosive.  They did the whole \"App of the Future\" thing, which was cool, but nonexistant.  I was happy that Macromedia acknolwedges their competition, and I hoep their estimation of Redmonds forays into Flash killing are correct. However my view of the keynote might have been negatively influenced by airplane like seating conditions.\n\nFinally there was the monster 3 hour <a href=\"http://www.macromedia.com/macromedia/events/max/sessions/sa310s.html\">Advanced ColdFusion MX 7 Features Exposed</a>. It was good. Some part were old hat, but they really did a good job of explaining why these features that I never used before were worth using. I found myself saying \"I could do that here\" or \"That could help with that project\" which is a very good thing to come  out of such a session.  If nothing else, their section on combining Flex and CF has rekindled my interest in Flex.\n\nAll in all a god day.

It gave me a lot of good ideas about what to do to make these processes more robust.  If you do this type of work, check out this class either tomorrow, or in the materials.\n\nThe keynote was ok, although I had an aisle seat which helped a bunch.  The skit thing was a little silly, and didn\'t add much to the experience.  Both Adobe and Jermey Allaire had incredible presentations that kinda over shadowed Macromedia.  I guess this isn\'t so bad though, as Allaire\'s new product was based on Flex, and Adobe will be the brand soon so no big deal there.\n\nAfter lunch, I found out that <a href=\"http://www.macromedia.com/macromedia/events/max/sessions/sa205h.html\">Leveraging Cold Fusion Components in ColdFusion MX 7</a> was a little to basic for me.

As far as I\'m concerned they\'re preaching to the choir. However, I wonder if this means that the company will get behind Webstandards for their products.  I\'m looking at you ColdFusion.</p>\n\n<p>Now, for the most part, it is very easy to write Webstandards based HTML/XHTML with ColdFusion.  That is as long as you aren\'t using Flash Forms, or &lt;cfchart&gt;.  Basically anything that embeds Flash uses the backward compatible Flash embedding, and &lt;cfchart&gt; even in .jpg or .png mode still creates image embedding code that isn\'t Webstandards compliant. </p>\n\n<p>I understand the need to balance the ideal of Webstandards compliance against actually working with the browsers that people are actually using.  But can\'t we have a boolean on those tags that embed content that developers can use to choose for themselves to support old browsers.  Maybe we could even pass in a HTML/XHTML version to comply with.  </p>\n\n<p>Not that I don\'t love the work that the ColdFusion development team has done, but Adobe brought it up.

And I\'ve written some dullards. If you start to fall asleep, look at the pretty tables. </p>\n\n<p>It is recommended to use CFC\'s for \"business logic\" encaspulation, and leave UI encapsulation to custom tags. This is based on what we\'ve read out on the Adobe Blogs about the subject.  There\'s one problem with that I dislike custom tags.  I have no reason for it. I could argue that I prefer a few large files as opposed to many small files.  This is probably why I jumped onto CFC\'s so quickly.</p>\n\n<p>Consequently, I\'ve been doing UI encapsulation in CFC\'s.  Specifically, I put all of my reused UI components (headers, footer, navigation menus) in a single CFC named \"interface.cfc.\" I then push that to the application scope, and call it from there.   I will totally own up to the fact that this is my personal preference.</p>\n\n<p>However at a code review, my coworkers and I got into a discussion of the pro\'s and con\'s of using such a memory resident \'output\' CFC .  The discussion of to Custom Tag or CFC came up again.  At the end of the discussion, I was willing to leave it at \"It is a stylistic concern and not a performance based concern. \"  But frankly, that was based on what I knew about CFC execution and gut feelings, but certainly not hard facts.  So I decided to do some performance tests. </p> <p>I created a custom tag that outputted the letter \'H\' with no  markup. I created a CFC with a method named test, that outputted the letter \'H\' with no markup.  I then created an index page that would loop through both calls the same number of iterations, and record the length of time it took to loop through the calling method at that iteration count.  I tried three different methods:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Straight Custom Tag Call</li>\n<li>Invoke on an CFC directly</li>\n<li>Invoke on an CFC that had been placed into memory as an object.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>My hypothesis was that method number 3 would be the fastest performer, but that it wouldn\'t be an order of magnitude thing, just a percentage thing. </p>\n\n<table>\n<caption>Figure 1. Results of CFC comparisons on Development servers at 10 Iterations</caption>\n<tr><th>Methodology</th><th>Average Time (ms)</th></tr>\n<tr><td>CFC Invoke from Memory</td><td>23</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Custom Tag</td><td>33</td></tr>\n<tr><td>CFC Direct Invoke</td><td>68</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<p>My first test upheld the hypothesis, but the differences there were pretty small so I fooled around with the number of iterations until I found one that ran quickly, but still showed clear patterns. The number I came up with was 1000.  Below that it all method were too fast to see any difference.</p>\n\n<table>\n<caption>Figure 2. Results of CFC comparisons on Development servers at 1000 Iterations</caption>\n<tr><th>Methodology</th><th>Average Time (ms)</th></tr>\n<tr><td>CFC Invoke from Memory</td><td>2313</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Custom Tag</td><td>4272</td></tr>\n<tr><td>CFC Direct Invoke</td><td>5542</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<p>That continued to uphold my hypothesis. However, I was running it the code on a development server. There are differences between the performance of development and production servers.  Debugging information gathered on our development servers tends to slow down CFC method execution.  So I ran that same iteration test on a production-configured instance of ColdFusion that sits on our development server.  It has debugging turned off.  Other than that there is no difference, same hardware, same memory allocation. Here are those results. </p>\n\n<table>\n<caption>Figure 3. Results of CFC comparisons on Production  servers at 1000 Iterations</caption>\n<tr><th>Methodology</th><th>Average Time (ms)</th></tr>\n<tr><td>CFC Invoke from Memory</td><td>39</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Custom Tag</td><td>1262</td></tr>\n<tr><td>CFC Direct Invoke</td><td>2649</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<p>That\'s not a typo. On a production-configured machine CFC invocation from memory will run in about  3% of the time it will take Custom Tag execution to occur even for output components.</p>\n\n<p>I figured I\'d share these results and see if I\'m on to something, or did I miss something major in my methodology. Does this change anyone\'s mind on using CFC for output?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Source Files:</strong> If you would like to reproduce my experiment, please feel free to give it a try:   <a href=\"http://www.numtopia.com/terry/files/perftestcfcvscustomtag.zip\" title=\"Source Code for \'Empirical Testing of Custom Tag vs. CFC for Output\'\">Source Files</a></p>    ','Empirical Testing of Custom Tag vs. CFC for Output','','publish','open','open','','empirical_testing_of_custom_tag_vs_cfc_for_output','','','2006-05-19 12:27:02','2006-05-19 12:27:02','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/empirical_testing_of_custom_tag_vs_cfc_for_output',0,'post','',11),(56,1,'2006-05-23 23:28:35','2006-05-23 23:28:35','<p>I just installed the Office 2007 Beta.

A few of them stuck with me and so I went and tweaked my trials. </p>\n\n<p>First <a href=\"http://ray.camdenfamily.com/\" title=\"Raymond Camden\'s ColdFusion Blog\">Ray Camden</a> pointed out that there\'s more to consider than just performance when evaluating coding practices.  He is completelyright in that point and I completely agree. However I was interested in whether or not there was more than just a stylisticdifference between the methods (output using Custom Tags versus using CFC\'s) I was exploring.   One of the attributes I was looking at was performance. </p>\n\n\n<p>But <a href=\"http://corfield.org/blog/index.cfm\" title=\"An Architect\'s View - ColdFusion, Software Design, Frameworks and more...\">Sean Corfield</a> pointed out that maintainability was the chief attribute that leads him to prefer Custom Tags.  Specifically, that CFC\'s couldn\'t be easily edited by traditional web designers. I buy that. . </p>\n\n<p>Sean then went on to point out that my number didn\'t match what he was able to get on his laptop.  Under his tests with Trusted Cache turned on, he was able to get Custom Tag performance to match CFC performance. I went back and noticed that my \"production\" instance didn\'t have the Trusted Cache turned on.  So I reran the tests with Trusted Cache enabled. </p>\n\n<p>Finally, <a href=\"http://www.mdprofinish.com/\" title=\"Maryland Profinish\">Mark Fuqua</a> pointed out that I wasn\'tusing a realistic output function.  Specifically, it just dumped the letter \'h\'.  So I created a simple navigation &lt;ul$gt; and the code encapsulator disables the link for the current page.  I then added an element of random selection for which navigation choice would be deactivated. (This will make more sense if you look at the code.)  . </p> <p><strong>Results</strong></p>\n\n<p>I had to up the number of iterations to 10000 to tease out a difference. As you can see, the difference is negligible.</p>\n\n<table>\n<caption>Figure 1. Results of CFC comparisons on Production servers with the Trusted Cache Enabled at 10000 Iterations</caption>\n<tr><th>Methodology</th><th>Average Time (ms)</th></tr>\n<tr><td>CFC Invoke from Memory</td><td>306</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Custom Tag</td><td>391</td></tr>\n<tr><td>CFC Direct Invoke</td><td>2200</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<p>So then I tried 10000 iterations with the Trusted Cache Enabled, and presenting a navigation list.</p>\n\n<table>\n<caption>Figure 2.

I\'m not convinced that they are really significant in that case.  So don\'t go out and rearchitect just yet.

Experts in each can probably get each to do most of what the other can accomplish. However, they work from different directions.\n</p><p>Ajax enhances a HTML website, and through enhancement after enhancement one can build a zippy web application that makes HTML do things it\'s not really imagined to do, but it works and that\'s actually a testament to the technology\'s flexibility, so no fault there.  Additionally Ajax can be added in very small doses to enhance a site one little section at a time.  Further I would go on to say that when combined with <a href=\"http://www.webstandards.org/\">Web Standards</a>, Ajax can build some very cool applications that can degrade but still work in less capable browsers.\n</p><p>Flex replaces the HTML interface with Flash, and focuses on building new interfaces for the data it\'s working with. It\'s really good at pushing bite sized chunks of data at a user, perhaps giving it a cool view like a chart or a customized display widget, and allowing the user to interact with it intuitively.  It\'s also important to point out that Flex makes it really easy to do so.  However, for maximum efficiency you need to write little self contained applications. You really shouldn\'t use it to enhance one drop down box or text box. (I know you can, but it doesn\'t mean that it is as easy as other things, or even the right way to do it.)\n</p><p>Sure you can make a complete web application in Ajax if you\'re one of the geniuses that work <a href=\"http://www.37signals.com/\">37Signals</a>, but for the rest of us, it\'s still a little daunting to do an entire application in Ajax.  <strong>In my opinion</strong>, it\'s a little harder to write a full web application in Ajax than in Flex.\n</p><p>Sure you could <a href=\"http://ray.camdenfamily.com/BlogCFC/bin/blogcfc.html\">write a blog in Flex</a>.  But even when you do, you admit that it\'s just proof of concept, and not really intended to be a real interface.  <strong>In my opinion</strong>, it\'s not good idea to deliver content that has a significant text component with Flex.\n</p><p>If you were to show a spectrum of web applications from \"content with some interactivity\" on the left to \"applications with small chunks of data\", on the right... then as you traveled from left to right you would start using Ajax, and at some point switch over to use Flex.  Where you make that decision really depends on your existing environment, and your comfort  level with the technology. (Perhaps whether or not you are 37Signals has impact on it, as does whether or not you are philosophically opposed to spending any money on software.)\n</p><p>So use the right tool for the job. Use Flex for rapid development of full blown web applications.  Use Ajax to enhance sites that contain a lot of text content or need to tolerate several levels of user interactivity.  Both can exist without annihilating each other.\n</p><p>Anyway, that\'s my, possibly inarticulate, opinion on it... Yours will probably vary. </p>  ','Flex versus Ajax Fight doesn&#039;t exist','','publish','open','open','','flex_versus_ajax_fight_doesnt_exist','','','2006-09-06 01:47:58','2006-09-06 01:47:58','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/flex_versus_ajax_fight_doesnt_exist',0,'post','',3),(72,1,'2006-09-11 15:50:07','2006-09-11 15:50:07','<p>I received this email today...\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>Dear Adobe MAX Registrant,\n</p><p>We have made some carefully considered changes to one or more of the program sessions for which you are currently registered.

But I\'m just back from my honeymoon, so my value of what is worthy of sharing might be off..\n</p><p>I ran into this problem yesterday.  Someone had styled their application with CSS using absolute positioning.   This caused the application to overlap the cfdebug output rendering both unreadable.\n</p><p>There are a few ways around this:\n</p><ol><li>Use debugging in dockable mode.\n</li><li>Add many &lt;br&gt;\'s to the end of the page.\n</li><li>Add a div with ID around the output in the classic debug template.\n</li><li>Style the debugging output directly.\n</li></ol><p> 1 was out, because it\'s a group development server, and the group hated the dockable version.  2 was out because it would have required altering every page of this particular application. 3 has the same issue as 1 for me... I don\'t like to make changes to the server that might potentially effect everyone\'s application.  So I had to go with 4, and here\'s how you do it:\n</p>\n<pre><code class=\"code\">\n&lt;style&gt;<br/>table.cfdebug {position: absolute;  top: 2000px;}\ntable.cfdebug * {position: relative; top: 0;}\n&lt;/style&gt;\n</code>\n</pre>\n<p>The first style declaration pushes the top level table with a style of cfdebug down 2000 pixels. The next one ensures that any child of the first table with a class of cfdebug does not get pushed down.\n</p><p>This form lends itself to solutions for other problems. Sometimes floats can cause the debugging to appear in odd places. With this you could float the cfdebug output, or a number of other things I can\'t think of at the moment. Just make sure what ever attributes you set in the first declaration are reversed in the second.  </p>  ','Styling CFDebug Output','','publish','open','open','','styling_cfdebug_output','','','2006-10-06 11:23:19','2006-10-06 11:23:19','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/styling_cfdebug_output',0,'post','',3),(75,1,'2006-10-16 11:39:51','2006-10-16 11:39:51','<p>Last week in a moment of hubris I decided to volunteer to do a <a href=\"http://barcamp.org/MAXUP\">MAXUP</a> session on what we at Wharton have been able to do with <a href=\"http://www.numtopia.com/terry/code_exchange_item_creator.cfm\">ColdFusion and Exchange</a>.

Jason Delmore , the Product Manager for ColdFusion informed us of something intriguing in his <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/events/max/sessions/wd301w.html\">Developing Hybrid Applications with ColdFusion and Java</a> and talk today. He informed us that ColdFusion strings are an extension of the Java String class.  Which means that methods of Java strings are available to ColdFusion. What does this mean?  It means that this is valid code:\n</p><code class=\"code\">&lt;cfset test_1= \"A string to test\" /&gt;<br/>&lt;cfset test_2= \"A string to add on to a string to test.\" /&gt;<br/>&lt;cfset test_1 = test_1.concat(test_2) /&gt;\n</code><p>Not only is it more elegant of other ColdFusion string concatenation techniques, it appears to run about twice as fast.\n</p><p>Also any other method listed in the <a href=\"http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/String.html\">Java String reference</a> will work.</p>  ','ColdFusion String Manipulation','','publish','open','open','','coldfusion_string_manipulation','','','2006-10-25 01:45:00','2006-10-25 01:45:00','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/coldfusion_string_manipulation',0,'post','',7),(82,1,'2006-10-25 02:12:00','2006-10-25 02:12:00','<p>Day one is finally over, and despite my slow start, I think that I got a full day\'s worth out of it.\n</p><p>I talked about it earlier, but the <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/events/max/sessions/ri101w.html\">Getting Started with Apollo</a> by <a href=\"http://weblogs.macromedia.com/mesh/\">Mike Chambers</a> was really worth it.

I have been waiting for this stuff for so long.  No more taking a random poll of my developers and seeing which one will cop to writing an infinite loop.

This is the only one that didn\'t wow me. Basically it was a laundry list of all of the image things you will be able to do with the potentially upcoming CFImage tag. It\'s not that this stuff isn\'t cool. It is.  And it wasn\'t that Prayank Swaroop wasn\'t a good speaker. He is.

They also placed third on the People\'s Choice Award. I\'m extremely happy for them. They do a such creative and innovative work, so they definately deserve it.\n\nI have to admit, I\'ve been a little light on the formal sessions today. Mostly because I was pretty nervous about my MAXUP presentation. I was following Ray Camden which was very intimidating. But it went really well.  For some reason I held on to my audience, which is decidely hard to do in that space since there is so much to distract one and it\'s so easy to leave. I suspect my cohorts from Wharton were blocking the exit paths.

Ray was giving his list of features he really wants for Scorpio, and I found myself saying \"Me too\" a lot.\n\nI think I\'m going to catch the 4:30 MAXUP session on Mission Critical Application Architechture, then stall until the ColdFusion Components Birds of a Feather tonight.

But MAX 2006 is pretty much over. I have to say, this has been my favorite MAX to date. I think the sessions I attended were awesome.  I didn\'t get stuck in too many mislabeled sessions.  I also really like participating in MAXUP.  I hope they do it again, and if you were thinking about doing it but didn\'t, you missed out.\n</p><p>So on to today.\n</p><p>The Sneaks Session was pretty interesting.  Despite (or perhaps because of) my strong interest in ColdFusion, I wasn\'t wowed by the features they showed off.  But in the ColdFusion\'s teams defense, I was wowed the first time I saw them.  <a href=\"http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/soundbooth/\">Soundbooth</a> looks awesome.  I\'ve dabbled in video and sound production, and it looks like Soundbooth was written for my type of user.  I know I have a sound, I know it needs modifying, but I don\'t know which frequencies I need to tweak. Soundbooth looks like it handles that case well. I\'m going to give it a try and also see what some more experienced sound people thing about it.  The Fireworks to Flex stuff was also awesome. It makes me happy that they\'re continuing the product, especially since they\'re tying it to one of their more important products. The rest of the stuff was cool, but outside of my ken.\n</p><p>I attended two sessions today that I think were very good.\n</p><p>First I attended the <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/events/max/sessions/wd305w.html\">ColdFusion .Net Integration</a> session.  <a href=\"http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/10/24/ColdFusion-Net-Integration\">Ray Camden did a great summary of it</a>.  I\'m excited about this because it has the potential to simplify some of the troubles I\'ve been dealing with over the past year.  Not in terms of programming, but in server consolidation and what not.  Another Wharton Computing Staff member, <a href=\"http://www.lifelikeweeds.com/\">Dave Konopka</a>, has some good thoughts about it.  I hope he blogs some of them like he\'s been threatening to do. We were able to corner the speaker, Rupesh Kumar and ask him some questions about why we would use this and not just continue relying on webservices to provide interactivity between .Net and Coldfusion.  He boiled it down to security, and performance which are better in the built in version. I buy that.\n</p><p>Tangentially, were all of the ColdFusion team trained by the CIA?  None of them would spill anything about Scorpio outside of the areas that they were revealing at MAX.\n</p><p>The second session that I want to mention was the <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/events/max/sessions/wd209w.html\">AJAX/Spry Framework Overview</a>.  I briefly looked at <a href=\"http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/spry/\">Spry</a> when it came out, but didn\'t have time to fool around with it. This is going to make me make the time. I can\'t believe how easy and powerful it looks. Additionally, they spell out a philosophy for it that makes a tremendous amount of success. Once they make it easy to degrade your pages gracefully I\'m totally onboard.\n</p><p>Adobe, you\'ve done your job.

Someone was complaining about the fact that their administrators were too restrictive despite not understanding the ColdFusion service. They were unable to see CFC introspection because of an administrator password.  So I suggested they disable security programmatically.\n</p><p>After thinking about it for awhile, I decided that it was an interesting challenge.

Remember when you said \"Just don\'t use the This scope in CFC\'s.\"? <br/>And then I said \"No, I can totally use it.\" <br/>And then you said \"No, you totally can\'t\"   <br/>And then I was all like \"I totally can!\"<br/>Yeah?<br/>Well I was totally wrong.\n</p><p>(In case your wondering this conversation happened entirely in my head.)\n</p><p>We were having a weird issue with one of applications.  It uses cookie based authentication that was written centrally into a cfc, and every once in awhile users were getting someone else information. We couldn\'t track it down. The CFC was all properly var scoped.  However it turns out that it was using the This scope to return the results of each function. The CFC was instantiated in the application scope of the calling application.  So things like this were happening:\n</p><ul><li>User 1 authenticates.\n</li><li>Application.Obj.username is set to User1\n</li><li>User2 authenticates\n</li><li>Application.Obj.username is set to User2\n</li><li>User1 sets session.username to Application.Obj.username\n</li><li>User2 sets session.username to Application.Obj.username\n</li><li>Both are User2 in their session\n</li></ul><p>This is dumb stuff from me. At the time I wrote it, like a year and a half ago, I assumed no one would instantiate the CFC to the application scope. But now time has proven me wrong. It just goes to show, that no matter how small your application is, or how narrowly you think it is going to be used, always follow best practices, unless you have <strong>a specific reason</strong> not to do so. If I had just set the proper response to be returned from the function instead of in the this scope, I wouldn\'t be rewriting code, and trying not to break existing calls to this central CFC in 20 or so applications by 10 or so different developers.  </p>  ','I&#039;m a This-Scoping Fool','','publish','open','open','','im_a_thisscoping_fool','','','2006-11-09 15:13:18','2006-11-09 15:13:18','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/im_a_thisscoping_fool',0,'post','',4),(89,1,'2006-11-30 15:13:57','2006-11-30 15:13:57','<p>I was giving a presentation today on CFC\'s, and was explaining the difference between the variables scope, the \'local\' scope, the this scope, and the arguments scope.

You might need to refresh your browser, to see it.\n</p><p>From the start I decided to do it a little different. First I did a site map, figuring out how all of the content was laid out in my site.  I figured out that a few sections were extraneous, so I excised them, and consolidated others.\n</p><p>Then I did a wireframe.  I figured out that I wanted a 4 column layout.  I wanted navigation to be a vertical list on the left.  I wanted a side \"ad\" or high attention section like before.  I also wanted a fixed layout.  I need to brand on to my hands \"You don\'t design liquid layout sites that you yourself like\" so I stop trying to do one.\n</p><p>Once all that was done I started working on a design. I started first by letting go of all of the previous colors in the site.  Instead I looked for a pretty neutral palette.  (I\'ve been watching too many home flipping shows.)

I know it\'s a Vista font and most people don\'t have it yet, so I\'ve gone back and made sure it looks okay in Verdana and Helvetica.  One thing I don\'t like about Calibri is that it\'s decidedly smaller at a given font-size than Verdana, or Arial. I\'m sure someone who knows something about fonts could tell you exactly why.

For those of you who don\'t know, Gadgets are little HTML, JavaScript enabled applications that run on the desktop and server up little bits of information like weather, or stocks, or what have you.  For those of you that are saying \"OSX has had them for awhile... they\'re called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard_%28software%29\">widgets</a>,\" Shhhh, be quiet. Apple stole the idea from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konfabulator\">Konfabulator</a>, who stole it from Apple, who probably stole it from Xerox.  But let\'s just say the idea has been around for awhile, and we all think it\'s cool.\n</p><p>Anyway... I\'ve been writing a Gadget, and it\'s shockingly easy. However I\'m annoyed at the prospect of translating it to a OSX Widget. It\'s HTML, it\'s JavaScript, it\'s CSS; a widget is HTML, a widget is JavaScript, a widget is CSS. Why the hell do I have to do any translation? This is the age of <a href=\"http://www.webstandards.org/\">Web Standards</a>, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture\">SOA</a>, I thought I would never have to work to make a basic HTML application cross platform again.   Both Microsoft and Apple deserve a little finger wagging here.  <strong>You\'re making us take a giant step backwards!</strong>\n	</p><p>I could rewrite it as a <a href=\"http://widgets.yahoo.com/\">Yahoo! Widget</a>. That would make it cross platform. But I would have to rewrite it as XML and JavaScript. (Not as much fun as HTML and JavaScript. ) Plus, it\'s not like Yahoo! Widgets is lighting up the Internets.\n</p><p>If only there was a cross platform application engine that could present applications written in HTML and JavaScript. It would harness the ease of HTML and JavaScript development with a portable runtime. It could also package them into self contained little applications that don\'t need the screen real estate of an entire web browser.\n</p><p>Oh wait, isn\'t that what <a href=\"http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Apollo\">Apollo</a> is supposed to be? Can\'t it do Flash and Flex too? Isn\'t it also going to package whole applications, not just nuggets of applications?\n</p><p>I finally get it Adobe.  I was <a href=\"http://www.numtopia.com/terry/blog/archives/2006/10/max_2006_first_impressions.cfm\">lukewarm at first</a>.  But now that I see how effective these little applications can be, how easy they are to write, and my frustration with platform issues, I totally get it now. Assuming you can leverage your <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/player_census/flashplayer/version_penetration.html\">\"Version Penetration\" for Flash</a> into seats with Apollo, you will kick the crap out of all of those other options.\n</p><p>But now I want Apollo. Crap.\n</p><p>Oh well, my plan is to keep writing the occasional Gadget, really get the whole Ajax thing down, and be better positioned to take advantage of Apollo when it is released.\n</p><p>     </p>  ','Gadgets and Widgets and Apollo, Oh My!','','publish','open','open','','gadgets_and_widgets_and_apollo_oh_my','','','2007-01-17 01:57:39','2007-01-17 01:57:39','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/gadgets_and_widgets_and_apollo_oh_my',0,'post','',5),(94,1,'2007-01-18 16:53:30','2007-01-18 16:53:30','<p>This is a post I\'ve been mulling for awhile and since my office is so cold that I can\'t concentrate, I figured I would give it a shot.\n</p><p>In addition to writing applications in ColdFusion I\'m also responsible for maintaining our environment. Our environment consists of 20 or so full time developers, with another 10 to 20 or so part time developers. Our code lives on around 20 servers, which are split up according to different versions and purposes. We run sub-environments for ColdFusion 6, ColdFusion 7 and Flex 1.5 (which is a much different animal then Flex 2.0.)  The developer\'s group as a whole maintains about 100 or so applications. These applications range in size from a simple one form troubleshooting reporting tool to our student portal that serves our entire student body, and won a <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/macromedia/events/max/max2004/max_awards/\">Max Award for Education Experiences back in 2004</a>.\n</p><p>I figured I would share some of my observations about what has made our environment more stable over the past three years.  Maybe it can help; maybe I\'m wrong and need correcting.\n</p> <p><strong>Develop, Stage, and Production\n</strong></p><p>Break up your environment into a development area, a staging area, and a production area. We do this by having two servers per sub-environment: development/staging and production.  We host development and staging on the same hardware, and use separate ColdFusion instances to separate staging from development. If you can\'t make the investment in a separate server for production, then run it as a third instance.\n</p><p><strong>Load Balance If You Can\n</strong></p><p>Most of our production servers are actually load balanced clusters and not stand alone boxes. This means that patches that require a reboot don\'t have to mean downtime for you users. You just \"drainstop\" to one node of the cluster. Update the deactivated node. Reboot and repeat.  Being able to patch production servers during the day on Microsoft Patch Tuesday when there are Zero Day exploits?  Priceless.\n</p><p><strong>Write Code that Knows Where It Is\n</strong></p><p>We have a couple of shared modules that allow code to determine if it is in development, staging, or production. It does this through a combination of file structure, CGI variables and registry information. Then variables can be set accordingly. That way, you don\'t have to code around application state.\n</p><p><strong>Don\'t Produce, Publish\n</strong></p><p>Don\'t allow anyone, including your fellow administrators, to directly touch code in the production environment. Code should be published from staging.  It doesn\'t matter how. On most of our sub-environments we use a centrally available system that allows developers to push code to production. On one of our sub-environments it\'s just a scheduled task that copies staging over to production every N minutes.  This way developers, <strong>including yourself</strong> are forced to test in staging, before users start seeing errors due to a bad update.   It also obfuscates more details about the production environment from our developers.  If we add a cluster node to server, it doesn\'t matter to the developers; publishing just takes care of it.\n</p><p><strong>Share the Wealth\n</strong></p><p>We do this three ways:\n</p><p>First, we write boilerplates that define a very loose framework than makes sure all applications do certain things \"right.\"  Things like forcing login information to be posted over SSL, and encouraging the use of central code nuggets when proper.\n</p><p>Then we write central code nuggets, like encapsulated and logged LDAP calls, or authentication routines. We solve these problems once, and make sure everyone else can benefit.\n</p><p>Finally, we have our own <a href=\"http://seven-dev.wharton.upenn.edu/devcenter/\">Developer\'s blog</a> that we maintain for sharing internal information, and for posting announcements. We tied in publishing, so our developers have to look at it from time to time.\n</p><p><strong>Tell Everyone How You Really Feel About Them</strong>\n	</p><p>They\'re painful, boring, cathartic, and frustrating all at the same time.  <a href=\"http://www.developer.com/java/other/article.php/3579756\">Other people have written more about them ad nauseum</a>.  So I\'m going to just say <em>\"No matter how painful they can be, you really need to do code reviews.\"</em> We typically make code review a condition of being allowed to publish to production.\n</p><p><strong>Miscellaneous\n</strong></p><p><strong>Patch  your machines</strong>.

Hopefully I\'m not overstaying my welcome on the topic.\n</p><p><strong>Developers are your Users\n</strong></p><p>This might be an odd bit of information, and you shouldn\'t forget about the users of the applications, but developers are your users. This has a few different implications:\n</p><p><strong>Development servers are production servers as far as your developers are concerned</strong>. I learned this the hard way a few years back when we lost our production environment due to a compromise. (Yeah, I had a server or two hacked, don\'t judge me.) We only had a single node production environment. Part of our recovery plan was, in case of emergency, use the staging environment as the production environment.  This could work for a day or two, but day three came around and the complaining started.  Perhaps justified, but when you are trying to get a new production environment up, you don\'t want to hear \"we need to work.\" In the end, you want to make sure that the development servers stay up during regular working hours.\n</p><p><strong>Users have their own definition of what is and is not your responsibility</strong>. \"<em>What\'s that you say?  You deleted your entire directory, and want me to run a backup?\"</em> Developers will eventually either accidently wipe out files, or go down a bad path with their code and want a restore. We\'ve all done it, but as an administrator you\'re going to want to ensure that their problems don\'t become yours.  Make sure they have access to a source control product. Encourage them to use it.  If you\'re running on Windows enable Shadow Copy. If you do regular tape backups try and have a local backup that you can easily restore from.  The idea here is that at some point you will be asked to run a restore, you want to make sure that you never really have to.\n</p><p><strong>Don\'t be an asshole about security</strong>.  I know I just said something about being hacked, but bear with me.  The first of <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/technet/archive/community/columns/security/essays/10imlaws.mspx?mfr=true\">Microsoft\'s Immutable Laws of Security</a> is:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>If a bad guy can persuade you to run his program on your computer, it\'s not your computer anymore.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Your developers can run code on your server; by definition you are already compromised. Don\'t lock down tags.  Don\'t prevent object creation.  A smart annoyed developer will get around you.  The administrator is pretty easy to get around if you can do any sort of file manipulation.  Even if this doesn\'t work, there are many ways a developer can outsmart you if you are unnecessarily restrictive.\n</p><p>Obviously this is for groups of developers that work for the same company.  I hope hosting companies don\'t have this attitude. Additionally, don\'t ignore external security.\n</p><p><strong>Be open about your standards</strong>. A few years ago people left every code review we had saying, \"Why didn\'t anyone tell us about these new standards?\" The reason was that the central group of administrators trolled the blogs, read articles and paid attention to what was the newest recommendations. We would talk about them, and come up with new guidelines. Problem was that we didn\'t talk to the rest of the group until code reviews came up. My group started posting our standards on our Developer\'s blog, and now people don\'t leave code reviews feeling like they\'ve been ambushed.\n</p><p>\n </p><p>That\'s it for now, I\'m sure I remember something afterwards which can wait for an eventual part 3.</p>  ','Running a ColdFusion Shop 2','','publish','open','open','','running_a_coldfusion_shop_2','','','2007-01-25 21:30:00','2007-01-25 21:30:00','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/running_a_coldfusion_shop_2',0,'post','',2),(96,1,'2007-01-26 02:15:39','2007-01-26 02:15:39','<p>One of the features I love about Word 2007 is the fact that I can write my blog with it.

To that end, I\'ve been working on what I consider a development tool, but others I have talked to have called a baby framework.  My gut feeling is that it might be a little bit too specialized for mass consumption, but I figured I would see if anyone else could use something like this.\n</p><p>\n </p><p>For this to make sense I need to tell you a bit about my workplace environment:\n</p><p>\n </p><ul><li>We run ColdFusion 6 and 7, against large installations of MS SQL.\n</li><li>The Admin team (of which I am a member) mandated that developers cannot use direct SQL calls in ColdFusion, instead that we have to use Stored Procedures.

This is far inferior in terms of feature set and flexibility than either of these solutions. There is a lot this thing doesn\'t do.  But is also doesn\'t require you to come completely over to the frameworks camp. It doesn\'t require you to learn MVC. To that end, it fits my environment.

I may have to do more code reviews in the near future, so it was a good time for me to gather myself and think of all the principles I should keep in mind.  Also, if anyone else has any thoughts on the matter, I would love to hear them.\n</p> <h3>Define Your Goals\n</h3><p>This seems a little weird at first. <em>\"Our goal is to write good code.\"</em> Well yes and no. The group that I manage is in charge of administering the SQL, ColdFusion and IIS boxes.  My personal goal with code reviews is to ensure I don\'t get paged at 2am because our servers are down.  I primarily look for performance and security issues. Another member of the code review team might manage a team of programmers; they might be looking at compliance with an accepted set of conventions, because their goal is to make sure that when changes need to be made, anyone on the team can quickly make them.  Still another person on the code review team might be focused on usability as their goal is to comply with government regulations.\n</p><p>It\'s okay that there might be more than one goal.  Just figure out what your organization\'s goals are, and shape your team\'s goals accordingly. My team\'s goals are:\n</p><ol><li>To protect shared resources from performance problems due to inefficient code.\n</li><li>To show off new and interesting techniques\n</li><li>To learn from each other\'s experiences\n</li></ol><h3>Define Standards\n</h3><p>Now that you know what your goals are you need to come up with what the rules are.  I start with the <a href=\"http://livedocs.macromedia.com/wtg/public/coding_standards/contents.html\">Adobe CFMX Coding Guidelines</a>. I look at performance and security issues, and then start building out rules from there.  Then I collect tidbits from other online sources, and start lumping them all together.\n</p><p>I need to say, before I started any of this, I read my copies of the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Macromedia-ColdFusion-Web-Application-Construction/dp/0321223675/ref=pd_bxgy_b_text_b/104-9599034-4818305\">ColdFusion MX 7 Web Application Construction Kit</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Macromedia-ColdFusion-Application-Development/dp/0321292693/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_b/104-9599034-4818305\">Advanced ColdFusion MX 7 Application Development</a>.  These are so fundamentally important to writing good ColdFusion, that we don\'t even bother telling people to read them.  You start working for us, you get handed copies of them.\n</p><h3>Publish Them\n</h3><p>This seems to be a no brainer, but people really get annoyed when they come to a code review and are told they\'ve violated our super secret standards. Now in our mind, they\'re never secret.  Everybody who is reading the blogs know what techniques are out of favor now right? Well no, because not everyone who codes in your organization keeps up to date with the ColdFusion blogosphere. So you need to tell them what they standards are. We do this by including a blog in our development center that has a category named \"Best Practices.\" We add to it as techniques or situations come up. We then force our developers to see the blog, because the rest of our development tools are on the same site.\n</p><h3>Give Directions\n</h3><p>We very tell people the following:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul><li>Make sure your application conforms to current best practices\n<ul><li>Read the Devcenter <a href=\"http://seven-dev.wharton.upenn.edu/devcenter/index.cfm?method=list_by_tag&amp;tag_id=3\">Best Practice Entries</a>.\n</li></ul></li>\n<li>Prepare CFML, HTML, CSS\n<ul><li>Make a local copy of your code. Feel free to include stylesheets, but don\'t bother with images.\n</li><li><strong>Remove database, or other passwords from code.</strong>\n				</li><li>Remove any unused templates\n</li><li>Clean any commented code out of your applications\n</li><li>Remove development diagnostic code like &lt;cftimer&gt; or &lt;cfdump&gt;\n</li><li><strong>Remove database, or other passwords from code.</strong>\n				</li><li>In short, code should be ready to go to production when reviewed.\n</li></ul></li><li>Prepare SQL\n<ul><li>All SQL going against a database server must be called in a stored procedure.\n</li><li>Use Query Analyzer to properly index tables. [Link to tutorial]\n</li><li>Use Enterprise Manager to generate scripts for all tables, including indexes. [Link to tutorial]\n</li><li>Use Enterprise Manager to generate scripts for all stored procedures. [Link to tutorial]\n</li></ul></li><li>Prepare Flow Chart\n<ul><li>Use Visio or some comparable program to chart the flow of your application.\n</li><li>Visio can be obtained from [Link to Central Installs location]\n</li></ul></li><li>Zip up all the collected files.\n</li></ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You may require other things. But make sure people are told what those things are.\n</p><h3>Read the code before the review\n</h3><p>Nothing irritates me quite as much as a reviewer who insists on not reading the code ahead of time.  To force others to wait because you say \"hold on\" as you flip through pages is incredibly disrespectful to you co-workers.\n</p><p>Some people print out all of the code, and review directly on the paper. With the size of applications these days, this is becoming more and more unwieldy.  I\'ve taken to using my two monitors and putting up code in one window, and <a href=\"http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/onenote/default.aspx\">Microsoft One Note</a> in the other. That way I can just record my thoughts, or copy and paste code.  Additionally, I don\'t waste paper.\n</p><p>Make clear and concise recommendations with references to specific lines of code.  Here is a sample from one of my reviews:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span><strong>Game\n</strong></span></p><p><strong>Application.cfc\n</strong></p><p>Line224\n</p><p><span style=\"color:blue\">Why do you raise the logout action to an application variable?

There are things that must be changed.  But we also place an appropriate priority on less important changes so developers against a deadline know what they have to do, and what they can negotiate with us over.\n</p><h3>The Review\n</h3><p>The developer presents their application.  They tell us what its purpose is, any specific challenges they faced, or what problem they are trying to solve.  Then we usually go through the code technology by technology. (So Flex code, then ColdFusion code, then SQL, then XHTML/CSS etc.)  The team gives our feedback, and then discuss any points of contention.  (I think something is the best way to do it, but another review disagrees, and the developer has a specific reason for choosing to do it in a way other then what we think is \"best.\")\n</p><p>Keep it courteous. Keep it respectful.  And don\'t forget to praise the good things you find.\n</p><h3>Aftermath\n</h3><p>The developer should make changes to their code based on the review. The reviewers aren\'t done yet though.  Was anything \"widely accepted\" as best practices new to a developer?  Then it should be posted with your best practices; even if you have to repost it.  You may also have to sit down with your fellow developer and help them learn a new technique.\n</p><h3>Conclusion\n</h3><p>Code reviews are a necessary part of running a good programming shop. No one should be exempt; even the makers of the standards.  They can be painful, and ego bruising, but with a little preparation, the negatives can be downplayed, and the positives allowed to shine through.\n</p> ','On Code Reviews','','publish','open','open','','on_code_reviews','','','2007-02-06 13:06:46','2007-02-06 13:06:46','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/on_code_reviews',0,'post','',4),(101,1,'2007-02-08 00:56:12','2007-02-08 00:56:12','<p>You want people to find every problem with your code and publicly point them out?

I figured I would share my solution in case it could help anyone else.\n</p><p>The easiest way to do this is to add the user to the list of members of the group, as opposed to adding the group to the user.  (I\'m not 100% sure, but I think that you technically can\'t add a group membership to the user.)  You also need to do all modifications to ldap objects through their distinguished names, not their username, group name or as Microsoft likes to call it, \"samAccountName.\"\n</p><p>So you find out the distinguished name for the user, the distinguished name for the group, then add the user to the group.

It looks like this time it might stick.\n</p><p>My big problem with CFEclipse to date is that it has been incompatible with the way I have worked. I tend to work on many small projects, each with its own network share.  In Dreamweaver each of my sites point to the UNC address of the project\'s share. CFEclipse does not seem to handle files over UNC path\'s directly.  From the little bit of information I have been able to find, it looks like a problem with Eclipse, not CFEclipse specifically. It works just fine with mapped drives, but I have many projects, each with their own share, and that\'s a lot of mapped drives.\n</p><p>Now, one of the guys I work with, newly minted MXNA blogger <a href=\"http://www.lifelikeweeds.com/tech/\">Dave Konopka</a>, pointed out that I could just map the root of my web server. I have the ability to do so, because I have elevated privileges on my ColdFusion servers, seeing as how I built them.  Now I\'ve always viewed this as abusing my administrative rights since not all of our developers have these rights. I try to consume the services we provide as the rest of the developers here do, because 1, there\'s usually a good reason for doing things the way we do, and 2. It helps me spot . However, come to think of it, the whole reason that I have a whole bunch of smaller projects is because I am an administrator. So maybe it\'s not really cheating to do it this way.\n</p><p>Anyway, I\'m over that hurtle, I\'ve got a whole bunch of projects assigned, I\'ve integrated Source Safe, and giving it an honest try.\n</p><p><strong>What I like:\n</strong></p><p>I like <a href=\"http://www.cfeclipse.org/assets/movies/07_Snippetsfla.html\">Snippets</a>, especially after Mark\'s tutorial. I like default code folding. I love Control+Shift+D (&lt;cfdump&gt; for those that haven\'t used it). I love how much faster it is than Dreamweaver, especially working remotely. I love that the component explorer allows me to drop a fully written &lt;cfinvoke&gt; set down. (Well technically so does Dreamweaver, but CFEclipse does it much faster.)\n</p><p><strong>What Surprised Me:\n</strong></p><p>I\'ve gone ANT crazy. It\'s not really within the scope of CFEclipse, but now that I get ANT, I love it. It\'s so much easier to run build tasks now.\n</p><p><strong>What I don\'t like:\n</strong></p><p>I still wish the aforementioned difficulties with UNC paths weren\'t there.  Other than a few \"I\'m used to doing a different way\" problems that are just learning curve issue, I only have one other concrete issue.  I wish I could <a href=\"http://trac.cfeclipse.org/cfeclipse/ticket/38\">color the background of comments</a> to the bright yellow I\'ve gotten used to in Dreamweaver. (I know, it\'s coming. )\n</p><p>I think between the speed, the integration with ANT, and the general direction of the community, I might stick with CFEclipse this time around.</p>  ','My Slow Switch to CFEclipse','','publish','open','open','','my_slow_switch_to_cfeclipse','','','2007-02-14 11:57:58','2007-02-14 11:57:58','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/my_slow_switch_to_cfeclipse',0,'post','',5),(104,1,'2007-02-15 01:42:36','2007-02-15 01:42:36','<p>One of the requests I\'ve gotten for <a href=\"http://squidhead.riaforge.org/\">Squidhead</a> is a <a href=\"http://www.mysql.com/\">MySQL</a> version. Being the responsible Open Source author (or wanting to suck up to the people that are actually interested in it,) I tried to make it work with MySQL 5.0.\n</p><p>It did not go well.  Specifically, I cannot call MySQL stored procedures from ColdFusion using &lt;cfstoredproc&gt;. (I get a null error from indexOfIgnoreCaseRespectQuotes in the MySQL driver.)  It isn\'t an absolute deal breaker, but makes my job much, much harder. I have to branch off more than just the database interaction.  I would also have to branch off the CFC code too. (Which is much more complicated than the database stuff.)\n</p><p>So now I\'m stuck at a quandary:\n</p><ul><li>Do I do the work to get it to interact with MySQL at Squidhead\'s present level of features? OR\n</li><li>Do I start adding features to Squidhead, along just the MSSQL path, and go back later and add MySQL support for the whole thing?\n</li></ul><p>Part of my original logic behind doing it in MS SQL only, was that the problem I was trying to solve with Squidhead was DBA mandates of \"You must use stored procedures!\" My gut feeling was that this type of mandate was more likely to found in a shop with a more established database. I\'m not knocking MySQL here, but stored procedures were just introduced in version 5.0, and a lot of shops don\'t run it yet. Therefore less shops would mandate stored procedures with MySQL.  So it would be smarter to go after an Oracle version than a MySQL version.\n</p><p>Then there are the features that I would like to add.\n</p><ul><li>I would like to remove the requirement identities. (I would do CRUD against Primary Keys.)\n</li><li>I would like to add support for configuration metadata for things like \"ORDER BY.\"\n</li><li>I would like to decouple the custom tags from the data retrieval cfc methods.\n</li></ul><p>  Does anyone out there with either an interest in Squidhead, or experience with an open source product have any advice?</p>  ','MyWoes with Squidhead','','publish','open','open','','mywoes_with_squidhead','','','2007-02-15 01:42:36','2007-02-15 01:42:36','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/mywoes_with_squidhead',0,'post','',2),(105,1,'2007-02-17 20:15:26','2007-02-17 20:15:26','<p>I know, I know, we don\'t need another framework post.

While I\'m naming dropping, I feel the need to cite Joel Spolsky\'s <a href=\"http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000007.html\">In Defense of Not-Invented-Here Syndrome</a>.\n</p><p>I am not against frameworks. I\'ve tried coding against a couple.  I\'ve at least looked at most of them.  I don\'t currently use one.  The one I got the furthest with was Model Glue 2. I like it a lot, but I\'m just not productive enough in it yet to rely on it.  That means that I can accept that Joe Rinehart came up with a better solution to my problems than I, but I can\'t use them as productively, as I can use my own, perhaps flawed solutions.\n</p><p>It\'s that bit of logic that I think should be the key to using frameworks.  Use them where they will be more productive than your own efforts.\n</p><p>Follow what I mean here.\n</p><p>Let\'s say you are a database wiz.  You design textbook perfect databases in your sleep. You love seeing execution plans with no table scans.  You think it\'s cool when your queries have to use parallelism.  It would not be in your best interest to use a database framework like <a href=\"http://www.doughughes.net/index.cfm?filter=category&amp;categoryId=30\">Reactor</a>.  Why? Because you would be substituting <a href=\"http://www.doughughes.net/\">Doug Hughes</a>\' judgment for your own, <strong>where you provide the most value</strong>.\n</p><p>Well that\'s not quite true, because you don\'t exercise the full extent of your knowledge on every single piece of SQL interaction code you write. If Reactor makes 80% of what you do take 20% of the time it used to, then it still might be worth it to use, and then manage the exceptional cases.\n</p><p>Okay, I haven\'t convinced you - you still prefer the way you deal with your database to the way Reactor does. Okay, but you\'re still probably doing a lot of repetitive, rule based code like writing &lt;cfstoredproc&gt; code blocks with are more characters the actual SQL stored procedures you\'ve written. Perhaps you should write your own code generator. That\'s essentially what I did with <a href=\"http://squidhead.riaforge.org/\">Squidhead</a>, and it was easier than I thought, and a great experience for me.\n</p><p>Okay, database wiz, now it comes to the UI. You need to do an Ajax front end. What do you do?  Start writing JavaScript?    No! You told us you were a database wiz. If you\'re not a JavaScript wiz then stop and download an Ajax framework. Because at some point someone has better judgment than you about some of the technology you use.\n</p><p>Now I started with a database guy, but I could have started with an Ajax wiz, or a designer and the advice would have been analogous.\n</p><p>If your expertise is based on a certain set of skills, you would be nuts to accept someone else\'s judgment for yours.  But if you\'re not an expert in an area, that it is equally nuts to assume your judgment is better than an expert.\n</p><p>Pick frameworks and techniques that strengthen your weak spots.</p>  ','Yet another Framework Post','','publish','open','open','','yet_another_framework_post','','','2007-02-17 20:15:26','2007-02-17 20:15:26','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/yet_another_framework_post',0,'post','',7),(106,1,'2007-02-21 00:37:04','2007-02-21 00:37:04','<p>I\'m not talking about being unemotional about code, which would be \"objectively\".

Anything that could be a list is actually an array. So arguments and local variables are actually an array of &lt;cfargument&gt; declarations, as is local variables. You write getter and setters.  Actually I tend to write adders instead of setters as I\'m just adding content to properties that grow.  The getter that I write just concatenates all of the code and outputs it.\n</p><p>Here\'s the code:\n</p><p><a href=\"http://www.numtopia.com/terry/text/code/function.cfc.txt\">Function.cfc</a>\n	</p><p>You can even break it down even further.  If you wanted, each &lt;cfargument&gt; could be an object with each attribute being a property.  I didn\'t go that far in Squidhead, but I did break the &lt;cfstoredproc&gt; declaration into an CFC.\n</p><p>This works very well for highly structured code, like &lt;cfcomponents&gt;\'s , &lt;cffunction&gt;\'s and &lt;cfstoredproc&gt;\'s but it can be extended into less obviously structured code like custom tags.   I was able to convert most of my procedural code creators to object oriented code creators.\n</p><p>So for whatever that\'s worth, maybe this can help someone else out there.\n</p><p>  </p>  ','Thinking About Code Objectly','','publish','open','open','','thinking_about_code_objectly','','','2007-02-21 00:37:04','2007-02-21 00:37:04','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/thinking_about_code_objectly',0,'post','',4),(107,1,'2007-02-21 20:47:27','2007-02-21 20:47:27','<p>I\'ve been meaning to blog about &lt;cfntauthenticate&gt; for awhile, but I keep forgetting. However, someone had an issue with it today, and it spurred me on.\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>\n</p><p>I don\'t work for Adobe, so I have no idea why they did anything they did. Any supposition posted here is just that my supposition. Additionally, it\'s not meant as criticism, as for the most part &lt;cfntauthenticate&gt; does exactly what it is supposed to do.\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We\'re a Window shop that relies heavily on out Active Directory Domain.  We use it for LDAP mail routing, Exchange, and single sign on across our environment. From time to time we\'ve had issues with &lt;cfntauthenticate&gt; under certain outlier conditions. Let me take you through some of them.\n</p><p><strong>Too Many Groups\n</strong></p><p>Occasionally, we\'ll run in to singular users that cannot log into some applications but can log in to others.  We\'ll tease out variations in form inputs, and ensure the username and password works, and still can\'t figure it out. We\'ll look at our logs that track the reason for failure, and we\'ll see \"UserNotInDirFailure.\"  Even turning on the throwError option of the tag doesn\'t help.\n</p><p>Eventually we trace it back to the listGroups flag. Turn it off, it succeeds, turn it on, it fails. So it\'s something with the groups. Try taking some groups away from the user. Voila it stops failing.\n</p><p>Turns out, there is some number, N, of groups over which some sort of uncaught error will start to be thrown. It gets caught by the default error code and gets thrown as \"UserNotInDirFailure.\"  N is a little nebulous, as it is unclear to me what effects domain local groups versus global groups versus distribution groups has on N.

If you are using groups for let\'s say, authorization, revert to using LDAP for retrieving groups information.  Also you could just prune your group membership...\n</p><p><strong>Service Account Issues\n</strong></p><p>This is the one that happened today.  Every user\'s login was returning \"UserNotInDirFailure,\"  but only for a particular server. No changes in underlying networking were made.\n</p><p>My default recommendation: restart the server.  When the admin of that server did that the ColdFusion service didn\'t start. A quick check of the system logs showed that the login for the account the ColdFusion service was running under was failing. Turns out someone changed the password of it and didn\'t change it in the services configuration on the server.  It took about 36 hours before the problem was noticed.\n</p><p>According to the <a href=\"http://livedocs.adobe.com/coldfusion/7/htmldocs/00000301.htm\">documentation</a>, \"ColdFusion must run as a user that has the privilege to authenticate other users in the specified domain.\" So problems with the service account would cause problems with the tag.\n</p><p>No workaround here, just manage your service accounts properly.\n</p><p><strong>PDC emulator\n</strong></p><p>Active Directory domain controllers are intended to be redundant.  Except for something called Flexible Single Master Operations roles, or FSMO roles.  Each FSMO role makes the domain controller that hosts it unique in a fashion.  I\'m not going to go into all of it, but suffice it to say one of those FSMO\'s is \"PDC Emulator.\"  PDC stands for Primary Domain Controller, and was a feature of NT 4 and below.  Basically the PDC was the domain controller to which domain information was read from and written to.  Other domain controllers only allowed read operations. When Microsoft moved to Active Directory and multiple domain controller model, they left the PDC Emulator role in order to provide backward compatibility with tools that used NT 4 API\'s for various operations.\n</p><p>What does all this have to do with ColdFusion? It\'s my theory that &lt;cfntauthenticate&gt; uses the vestigial NT 4 API\'s.  I base this theory on the fact that if your PDC emulator is inaccessible, &lt;cfntauthenticate&gt; will fail for all users.  However, if you have throwError set to false, you won\'t know what is going on you\'ll get a \"UserNotInDirFailure\" error.  However, if you set throwError to true, you will see the real message, \"Could not find domain controller for this domain XXXX\" Where XXXX is the name of your domain.\n</p><p>There\'s not much you can do about this. If the PDC emulator is unreachable from your Coldfusion server, &lt;cfntauthenticate&gt; will not work.  The only solution I have come up with to replace &lt;cfntauthenticate&gt; with an analogous CFC that uses Secure LDAP queries against the domain controller instead.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion\n</strong></p><p>I blogged this because when I\'ve gone looking for &lt;cfntauthenticate&gt; errors, I\'ve only found <a href=\"http://www.houseoffusion.com/groups/CF-Talk/thread.cfm/threadid:46793\">my own random posts on CF-talk</a>.

Wait a minute from the description it seems like Squidhead just creates CRUD + list stored procedures.  The key to my disappointment is the word \"just.\" Squidhead doesn\'t just generate stored procedures.  It also reads in stored procedures that you create.  So sure, it scaffolds the basic CRUD and list actions building stored procedures and CFC\'s but also builds CFML from user defined stored procedures.\n</p><p>So for example, you have a table, <em>person</em>, with columns personid, username, password, first and last name.  You run Squidhead once, you get the 4 CRUD procs, plus a DAO CFC to call them, then you get a list proc, plus a gateway CFC to call them.  But then you go back and write a procedure \"<em>usp_person_select_by_username</em>\" because you would rather do that then select by identity. You run Squidhead again; it adds \"<em>select_by_username</em>\" function to the person DAO CFC.\n</p><p>But let\'s take it one step further, suppose you write a stored procedure named \"<em>usp_person_auth</em>\" that takes the username and password and checks them as an authentication routine.  Run Squidhead again.  You\'ll now have an \"<em>auth</em>\" function in your person gateway CFC.\n</p><p>The idea here is to do the database work in the database, and not have to do the manual work of writing the cfml calling code. Sure, it creates stored procedures, and that <em>is</em> a leg up, but it also lets those of us that like starting in the database an even higher leg up... (not sure if that\'s the right modification of that metaphor.)\n</p><p>Anyway, don\'t take this as a swipe at <a href=\"http://www.mattwoodward.com/blog/\">Matt</a> and <a href=\"http://blog.maestropublishing.com/\">Peter</a>.

Two of them were pretty major so I figured I would squawk some more about it.\n</p><p>First, I haven\'t forgotten about adding support for other DBMS\'s other than Microsoft SQL.  I haven\'t done it, but I have re-architected Squidhead slightly to make it a bit more possible to do so down the road.  There\'s one more step I need to take to open that up, which is focusing on primary key\'s rather than identity. I know it should work, but I\'m just not ready to pull the trigger on it.\n</p><p>Second, I\'ve added quite a few features around the main unique feature of Squidhead, stored procedures.  The whole focus of Squidhead is pulling in user created stored procedures and creating the ColdFusion code to support them. The recent changes I made allow Squidhead to properly handle store procedures that return multiple result sets.  Alternately it can handle multiple output parameters, from the stored procedures.\n</p><p>Third, I\'ve got a Build a Blog in 15 minutes presentation in the works.  It\'s a respectful homage, to <a href=\"http://www.firemoss.com/\">Joe Rinehart\'s</a>\n		<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHmp6E-icQo\">YouTube presentation</a> on <a href=\"http://www.model-glue.com/\">ModelGlue</a>. I figure it\'s effective in getting the feature set across, and appropriate since Joe\'s presentation got me into code generation and frameworks in the first place.\n</p><p>Finally, I have a pretty good idea of what\'s coming down the pike for Squidhead.  Before I add support for other DBMS, I\'m going to try and flush out the feature set, so as to avoid writing multiple versions in tandem. I prefer to port over the full version to other databases. My current list of updates includes support for foreign and primary keys.  I\'m also looking to add some form validation.

There were a couple misunderstandings about it, so I figured I would share the explanation publicly.\n</p><p>First, there are two types of whitespace what are in play here.  Whitespace in your code for the purpose of properly formatting, and extra whitespace in your ultimate HTML output that comes from the various loops and other mysterious sources in ColdFusion. In simple terms, the first is good and the second is bad.  However, you shouldn\'t try and get rid of the first in order to get rid of the second.\n</p><p>First, to see a demonstration of what I am talking about, go to <a href=\"http://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/brainstorm/\">Wharton Computing\'s Brainstorm</a>. Once you\'re there, \"View Source\" from your browser. At the top of the page, you\'ll see a few lines of empty space before the DocType declaration. Select them with your cursor. You\'ll see they\'re not just page breaks, but spaces and tabs.\n</p><p>Now, go to the <a href=\"http://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/wireless/\">Wharton Wireless Troubleshooter</a> (WWT). Do the same thing.  You\'ll notice a lot more whitespace at the top.\n</p><p>(I\'m not picking on some random developer; I did both of these applications.)\n</p><p>That\'s the easiest way to show you what I\'m talking about.  That whitespace makes the output HTML page bigger, as each piece of whitespace is a character that you are sending to you user.\n</p><p>Well how much of a problem is that little bit of whitespace? Well frankly not much, <strong>but</strong> if you understand how it gets created, you realize it can become a very big deal.\n</p><p>It gets created in loops that, in the case of the WWT, are being called before the header is rendered. (It can happen anywhere in a page, but that\'s where it\'s happening in this application.) So in the case of the WWT a few loops are generating say 1 character of whitespace per iteration.  But suppose for a moment that you were doing hundreds or thousands of iterations... In multiple loops... with multiple characters per iteration... in multiple included files.\n</p><p>Like everything in coding, it\'s not that one little thing is so bad, it\'s that the little bad things tend to aggregate together, form large bad things, gain sentience and run amuck!\n</p><p>So what can you do to prevent whitespace?  I could tell you. But <a href=\"http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/7/26/ColdFusion-Whitespace-Options\">Ray Camden does such a better job of it in his article about whitespace</a>.\n</p><p>I would just add two things.\n</p><ol><li>Ray mentioned a whole bunch of techniques you can use to reduce whitespace, but he doesn\'t say what not to do to reduce it. (Awkward sentence, but bear with me.) Y<strong>ou should not start formatting your source code to reduce the number of lines you use, the number of tabs, or the number of spaces</strong>. Readability of your code is still extremely important.  Don\'t change your code formatting to fix your html formatting.   Find the spots that generate the whitespace.  Then utilize the techniques he mentions to treat the problem topically. (My favorite method is to insert the &lt;yo /&gt; tag randomly throughout the source.)\n</li><li>If you\'re not sure if you have this problem with your page, or if you\'re not sure how big an impact the whitespace is having, use the tools at <a href=\"http://www.websiteoptimization.com/\">Web Site Optimization</a> to see how big your output page is.

When we as a group investigated further it was revealed that they had used it \"incorrectly,\" experienced problems for doing so, and labeled the try catch model as bad, instead of the implementation.   So I figured I would quickly go over my opinions of what you should be using them for.\n</p><p>To start with, the incorrect usage of &lt;CFTry&gt; was wrapping it around a troublesome page, so instead of visibly erroring, the page would just silently fail. To add insult to injury, there was an error in the cfcatch block which caused the whole thing to throw an application level error anyway.  This was, to put it mildly, a flawed use of &lt;cftry&gt; and &lt;cfcatch&gt;.\n</p><p>In a nutshell, the &lt;cftry&gt; and &lt;cfcatch&gt; model in ColdFusion is for handling expected errors, as opposed to handling unexpected errors.  ColdFusion has a pretty good system for handling unexpected errors - a combination of &lt;cferror&gt; tags, and use of onError in the application.cfc. So wrapping an entire page in &lt;cftry&gt; to catch any error that may come up is not only the wrong thing to do, it\'s also pretty redundant.\n</p><p>In my opinion &lt;cftry&gt; and &lt;cfcatch&gt; should be used to handle errors around small pieces of code that have the potential to error in predictable ways. For example here is a line of code from one of my applications:\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"code\">\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.0001pt\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: Consolas;

In my experience webservices can have issues with the skeleton ColdFusion creates to consume them, especially if details about the webservice change. However, my application has little control over this webservice. So I wrap the call to the webservice in a &lt;cftry&gt; block, and if my expected error condition occurs, (something with to do the skeleton, or \"stub objects\") I reset the webservice and try again.\n</p><p>You\'ll notice that if it isn\'t a \"stub objects\" problem, it assumes that it is some other issue, and rethrows the error so the application error handlers can tackle the problem. Why, because it is an unexpected problem, not an expected one.\n</p><p>In conclusion, I\'m not speaking for all programming languages, but at least in ColdFusion &lt;cftry&gt; and &lt;cfcatch&gt; should be used to handle error that you can predict.  The shouldn\'t be your default error handling technique, and like a &lt;Cflock&gt; or a &lt;cftransaction&gt; they should surround as little code as possible.  </p>  ','CFUse CFTry CFCatch','','publish','open','open','','cfuse_cftry_cfcatch','','','2007-04-04 14:39:27','2007-04-04 14:39:27','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/cfuse_cftry_cfcatch',0,'post','',6),(118,1,'2007-04-11 14:53:36','2007-04-11 14:53:36','<p>I just found out I get to go to <a href=\"http://www.cfobjective.com/conference/\">cf.Objective</a> this year.

Maybe not directly, but it was there.  Okay, so I didn\'t say it.  I\'m saying it now.  Backup your machines. Do a tape backup, export to an external drive, do anything.  Just backup your machines.\n</p><p><strong>Backup Configuration Files Separately\n</strong></p><p>Independent of a backup solution that takes care of your whole system, I would also recommend backing up configurations to separate location, in their current format. Meaning, don\'t put them on a tape, don\'t ship them off site.  Just keep them somewhere you can access them.  Why?  Coldfusion is pretty light. CFML sites are comprised of pretty small files. Odds are, if you have a systems failure, it very well may be faster to rebuild a system from scratch then it will be to get a system backup restored and working. Rebuild your server, reinstall your webserver, and reinstall ColdFusion, all while getting the CFML files from backup. Then use configuration files you\'ve stored elsewhere to restore both your webserver and Coldfusion to its old state. By this point, the CFML files should be out from a restore.\n</p><p>There are other uses for these files. You can use this method to clone your boxes, for clustering for example. Additionally, the ways they are broken up make it easy to share certain areas of configuration between machines.  The most useful of these is neo-query.xml, which has all of your datasources on it.\n</p><p>Anyway, you probably want to know where all of these are:\n</p><ul><li>ColdFusion configuration information is stored in xml files, in [CfusionRoot]lib.\n</li><li><div>IIS XML configurations can be exported from the IIS Manager\n</div><ul><li>Right Click website\n</li><li>Choose \"All Tasks\"\n</li><li>Choose \"Save Configuration to file.\"\n</li></ul></li></ul><p>I\'m sure that Apache has something to handle this too. But I don\'t have any experience with it.\n</p><p><strong>Backup Certificates\n</strong></p><p>If you are using SSL certificates, back them up.  They are a pain in the ass to manage.  If you lose one without a backup you have to depend on the Certificate Authority to get your SSL service back up. Better to just have them ready to go in case of a problem.\n</p><p>Again I can only speak authoritatively about IIS, but:\n</p><ul><li>Go to IIS Manager\n</li><li>Right click your SSL secured site\n</li><li>Choose \"Properties\"\n</li><li>Go to \"Directory Security\"\n</li><li>Under \"Secure Communication\" hit the \"View Certificate\" button\n</li><li>Choose \"Details\" tab\n</li><li>At the bottom \"Copy To File\"\n</li></ul><p>That will bring up the \"Certificate Export Wizard.\" I usually choose the default options, with one exception.  I choose \"Yes export the private key.\"  It\'s less secure, so you want to make sure you store them somewhere safe, but you\'ll be able to do this again with a certification created from a backup with the private key.\n</p><p>That\'s all I got this time around.  Sorry it\'s all backup related. Nothing happened; I was just collating tips for building a new Coldfusion box in our environment, and realized that these were all pretty important to doing that </p>  ','Running a ColdFusion Shop 3','','publish','open','open','','running_a_coldfusion_shop_3','','','2007-04-12 01:42:14','2007-04-12 01:42:14','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/running_a_coldfusion_shop_3',0,'post','',6),(120,1,'2007-04-17 19:23:09','2007-04-17 19:23:09','<p>I received an email today, that reminded me of a topic I wanted to throw up on my Running A ColdFusion Shop series.\n</p><p>The email:\n</p><p><em><strong>Subject</strong>: Mail Queues Need Attention\n</em></p><p><em><strong>Body</strong>: Hoth Spool could be backed up.\n</em></p><div>\n<table style=\"border-collapse:collapse\" border=\"0\">\n	<colgroup>\n\n		<col style=\"width:113px\"/>\n		<col style=\"width:136px\"/>\n		<col style=\"width:93px\"/>\n		<col style=\"width:33px\"/>\n	</colgroup>\n	<tbody valign=\"top\">\n		<tr style=\"background: #aa66aa\">\n			<td>query - Top 1 of 1 Rows</td>\n		</tr>\n		<tr style=\"background: #ffddff\">\n\n			<td>DATELASTMODIFIED</td>\n			<td>DIRECTORY</td>\n			<td>NAME</td>\n			<td>SIZE</td>\n		</tr>\n		<tr>\n			<td>04/17/2007 05:43:54 PM</td>\n			<td>C:CFusionMXMailSpool</td>\n			<td>Mail22186.cfmail</td>\n			<td>719</td>\n		</tr>\n	</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p><br/><em>To unblock spool:<br/>Drain stop node(wlbs drainstop) <br/>Restart Cold Fusion Service.<br/>Restore node (wlbs start) <br/><br/>Make sure before doing this that the node is actually backed up. <br/>One or two messages in the queue does not a blockage make. <br/>But depending on the number of items and length of their stay, you can make the determination.\n</em></p><p>What this email reminded me to say was: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself\"><strong>DRY</strong></a><strong> isn\'t just for code.</strong>\n	</p><p>We had this problem a while back.  Every once in awhile, the mail queues on a random one of our ColdFusion servers would back up.  The mail would remain stuck until the server was restarted.  Developers and users started getting pissed about their application email being delayed.\n</p><p>The short term solution was to check the queues every once in awhile.  Once the problem stopped occurring, we stopped checking... until it happened again.  We looked for a hotfix, to no avail.  We did this a couple times, and each time we got burned when we stopped being vigilant.\n</p><p>Finally I said \"Screw it; I\'m scripting a solution to it.\" I started checking to see if files were in the spool directory of all of our servers.  Then I had to make sure that the files had sat there for a little bit instead of just having been written there.

Maybe someone else has been seeing too, or seeing other issues. I\'ve omitted problems that deal with our shop\'s internal best practices, and tried to stick with things that would apply more globally. If I over applied something let me know. It\'s a long one, so more after the jump.\n</p> <p><strong>5. Improper implementation of Application.cfc inheritance\n</strong></p><p>Application Inheritnace is very useful for application and sub applications development.  However there is a gotcha to remember here. If you are going to override application variables that you set in onApplicationStart, they you need to give the application.cfc its own this.name.  Why?\n</p><ul><li>Imagine this:\n</li><li><div>Application.cfc\n</div><ul><li>This.name=parent\n</li><li><div>OnApplicationStart\n</div><ul><li>&lt;cfset application.title = \"Parent\" /&gt;\n</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><div>Child/application.cfc extends=\"../application\"\n</div><ul><li><div>OnApplicationStart\n</div><ul><li>&lt;cfset application.title = \"Child\" /&gt;\n</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>\n </p><p>In this case, assuming the application is not started, going to a page under the child will trigger onApplicationStart.  But since they have the same application name through inheritance, going to any parent page will not trigger OnApplicationStart, and they will be stuck with the application title of \"child.\"\n</p><p>The easy fix here is to always give children a different application name, only omitting it when you have a specific reason not to.\n</p><p><strong>4. Improper Access on CFC methods\n</strong></p><p>The four access types of CFC methods tend to cause people some confusion especially when they are learning the whole CFC thing.  They each have different implication for application security.\n</p><p>I\'ve pasted a more in depth guide below, but for the most part you probably shouldn\'t set access=remote. Even if you are writing a webservice, only the exact method you are calling needs to be set to remote, so don\'t set all of the methods called from your webservice to remote.\n</p><ul><li><div>Private\n</div><ul><li>Only accessible by other functions in CFC\n</li><li>Used for sub functions only relevant to CFC\n</li></ul></li><li><div>Package\n</div><ul><li>Only accessible by code in same folder\n</li><li>Any sort of organization makes this almost useless\n</li></ul></li><li><div>Public\n</div><ul><li>Accessible by any code on the server\n</li><li>Sounds scary, but relatively safe on a dedicate server\n</li><li>Use with caution on a hosted box.\n</li></ul></li><li><div>Remote\n</div><ul><li>Used for webservices.\n</li><li>If building webservices these should be accompanied by some security or logging.\n</li></ul></li></ul><p>\n </p><p><strong>3. Inappropriate use of a Query of Queries\n</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://livedocs.adobe.com/coldfusion/7/htmldocs/wwhelp/wwhimpl/common/html/wwhelp.htm?context=ColdFusion_Documentation&amp;file=00001266.htm\">Query of Queries</a> have many legitimate uses. They include but are not limited to:\n</p><ul><li>Performing SQL syntax queries on query objects returned from non-SQL operations. (Ex. &lt;CFLDAP&gt; &lt;CFDIRECTORY&gt;)\n</li><li>Joining the results of two queries made from two different sources (Ex. Joining MS SQL and Oracle data, or SQL and LDAP data.)\n</li><li>Providing multiple views to the same data on the same page request. (Ex. Showing a chart of data sorted multiple ways on the same page.)\n</li></ul><p>However, where they get deservedly shunned is when they are reproducing functionality that can be completely handled in native SQL. In my experience, this is often (but not always) done by developers who know Cold Fusion very well, but not advanced SQL, therefore when they can\'t get the problem solved in SQL they fall back on Cold Fusion to do what they need to get done. (At least that\'s what I was doing when I got yelled at for it.) <br/><br/>In many cases, it takes less time to post the SQL request to the database server and get the response back then it does for Cold Fusion to process the request on an in-memory query. It\'s counter-intuitive, but such is the power of indexing and SQL-based set operations. Case in point, when I was designing a dictionary check for a password change page, it made sense to load the entire dictionary into an application variable, and then do a query of queries on it. The process took 3000ms, or 3 seconds, which is slower than a request really should take. The same request against the database server took half that. Ultimately through indexing and query tuning, I got the process down to 100ms. <br/><br/>Your mileage may vary, especially depending on the size of the dataset, but the point remains that you should let SQL be SQL and Cold Fusion be Cold Fusion.\n</p><p>And by the way, I\'m not being original here, other people have said this:\n</p><p><a href=\"http://www.forta.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/12/1/ColdFusion-Is-Not-A-DBMS\">ColdFusion is Not a DBMS</a>\n	</p><p><strong>2. Fake Email addresses in error or reporting pages\n</strong></p><p>If your application sends email, those emails should be sent from a legitimate, addressable email address. (Whether or not the email goes to a list, a mailbox, or some other place is not a factor.) There are a couple of reasons for doing this:\n</p><ul><li>It is not inconceivable in the future that your organization, hosting provider, or your user\'s email host will start rejecting messages from invalid addresses due to spam considerations.\n</li><li>Any bounces generated from these messages will never get back to you.\n</li><li>Users responding to these messages will get ungraceful bounce responses.\n</li></ul><p>Of these reasons, 1 is probably the most important as spam or virus concerns have forced mailing hosts to make quick decisions like this without consulting others, due to the severity of the issue.

Microsoft doesn\'t make it any easier by breaking stuff when they push out updates.\n</p><p>I\'ve been working with it in the Beta tests and I can categorically say: <strong>Adobe has made it truly easy to interact with Exchange</strong>. Short of working in .Net, there is no easier way to programmatically interact with Exchange than with what the ColdFusion team achieved here. This is to say, having worked with .Net, <strong>there is no easier way to programmatically interact with Exchange than with ColdFusion 8</strong>.\n</p><p>I have some ideas for best practices of working with Exchange from ColdFusion when we can all talk more freely about it.

href=\"http://squidhead.riaforge.org/\">Squidhead</a> is swimming along nicely.  I\'ve gotten some good suggestions, over the last few weeks, and figured I would post what\'s going on.\n</p><p><a href=\"http://www.lifelikeweeds.com/tech/\">Dave Konopka</a>, who works with me here at Wharton, has a pretty good complaint about Squidhead.  Basically his complaint is that there needs to be another layer between the DAO and UI.  We\'ve taken to calling it the Business layer. Basically, many times his basic interaction with the database requires more than just one DAO operation, and often other operations not related to the database (logging, email, etc.)  So to achieve perfect encapsulation and reusability through the application, he requires the business layer.\n</p><p>He provided me with a good bit of code for it, which will create Business beans for any of the DAO operations. Additionally it abstracts the whole \"Is it an add or is it an update\" logic, making the UI have to do less work.\n</p><p>I\'ve added the business CFC creation routine to Squidhead and am working on rewiring the UI to use it. It will be optional, so that existing applications don\'t break, but it will be set to the default way of doing stuff.\n</p><p>Finally, I did get some requests for <a href=\"http://www.fusebox.org/\">Fusebox</a> integration, and <a href=\"http://www.mysql.com/\">MySQL</a> compatibility.

Things like webservices, and various other types of wrappers.  ColdFusion 8 will allow you to call .Net assemblies like CFC\'s or Java classes.  Additionally it will perform better than all the other wrapper methods. On the backend ColdFusion creates proxies, much like webservices use skeleton objects on the backend.\n</p><p>He then went on to the Exchange technologies. Claim: ColdFusion Exchange tags can do anything that the Outlook Client can.  Eh, not really, but it can do everything that you would want to build an application around.  You can manipulate contacts, appointments, mail items, and tasks.  You can\'t interact with say the Out Of Office message. \"You can do anything to the objects CF exposes that you can do in Outlook\" would be more accurate.\n</p><p>Interesting Ideas:\n</p><ul><li>.Net interaction will allow CF to extend Sharepoint.\n</li><li>.Net interaction will allow CF to interact with IIS\n</li></ul><p><strong>Mark Drew: The CFEclipse Project\n</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://www.markdrew.co.uk/blog/\">Mark Drew</a> confirmed that he was never on the show 24. He then took as on an overview of the CFEclipse project.\n</p><p>Most of the people here are using CFEclipse, so he powered through the existing features. He spent a fair amount of time showing off Snippets which definitely are powerful.\n</p><p>Then he revealed Project Unity. Which I\'m pretty sure is the killer application for CFEclpise.  It\'s a CFFramework inspector that allows developers to basically interact with Frameworks through a variety of methods. One method looks a lot like the Component Explorer, but it also allows snippet like inserts of calls to Framework components.\n</p><p>What\'s really cool about it is that it understands the frameworks. So if you inspect a Fusebox project you can inspect individual circuits.  If you inspect a Reactor project you can wire together relationships. In addition to viewing them, you can also edit them through a wizrd view that writes the code for you.\n</p><p>Finally it\'s full extensible, so if you have a framework, you can write your own XML to make it work with the CFframework explorer.\n</p><p>The key question is: When will it be released?\n</p><p>I figure I\'ll blog about the Birds of a Feather session after than tonight.\n</p>  ','cf.Objective Day 1','','publish','open','open','','cfobjective_day_1','','','2007-05-04 18:05:52','2007-05-04 18:05:52','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/cfobjective_day_1',0,'post','',5),(128,1,'2007-05-05 18:11:35','2007-05-05 18:11:35','<p>The beds at the Sofitel almost made me miss my first session.\n</p><p><strong>Matt Woodward: OO Architecture Back to Front\n</strong></p><p>The focus of this session was developing OO architectures starting at the database and moving forward.  <a href=\"http://www.mattwoodward.com/blog/\">Matt Woodward</a> started with a quick overview of OO.  One of the best things he explained was that all of the layers of an OO application serve to increase the coupling and <strong>decrease the</strong> cohesion of your application.  He went over a few basic patterns like DAO, Gateways, Beans, etc, and a few layers like service, business, controller etc.\n\n</p><p>Interesting tips and pointers\n</p><ul><li>You want to do multiple layers of validation.\n</li><li>Server side validation should probably live in the bean.\n</li></ul><p>This was a really good presentation about the whys and wherefores of the multiple layer development style.

Since the server monitor shows how much memory all of your scopes are taking up, you can figure out the capacity of your application on your server. Very cool.\n</p><p>Cool Bites:\n</p><ul><li>The server monitor has a force garbage collection button\n</li><li>Reports show the effectiveness of the query cache\n</li><li>You can see how the database connection pool is being used and queued\n</li><li>Configurable alerts so you can be notified if there are speed or responsiveness problems\n</li><li>Alerts can take snapshot dumps of the environment for troubleshooting after the fact\n</li><li>Configurable actions you can map to alert items.

SOA\'s = API\'s is a good way to think about this stuff. Things have to be done differently. Sean went over these difference.\n</p><p>SOA is about more than services. You need to have clearly defined data. Basically you need to agree on the same semantics when you talk about data, and the same components. For the most part you really have to document these applications, and then actually make this information available.\n</p><p>Software as a Service (SaaS) is growing as a market at 20 per year. SOA\'s are the backbone of SaaS.\n</p><p>Separation of concerns is very important to be doing this type of application.

Think objects in terms of what they do.\n</p><p>Hal starts at the UI and works down to the database.

Solution: an XML version of the variable structure that Squidhead uses to generate all of the procedures, functions, cfc\'s, custom tags, and cfml pages for an application.\n</p><p>So what happens is that at some point you freeze changes on the database, then you set Squidhead to use the disk cache instead of the database.  It will then allow you to change a couple of things in how the application works.\n</p><p>Currently you can only change three things (and have the change do something useful):\n</p><ul><li>DisplayName on database columns that will show as labels on all UI components instead of the name. (\"First Name\" vs f_name).\n</li><li>OrderBy on tables which will alter the order of the default List elements\n</li><li>ForeignKeyLabel the column which will be substituted for the primary key, in all tables that link to this table via foreign keys.\n</li></ul><p>Which leads me to...\n</p><p><strong>Foreign Key Support\n</strong></p><p>Squidhead now understands foreign keys. Here\'s how it works:\n</p><p>Form UI - On forms that interact with tables with foreign keys, Squidhead will produce a select box of the aforementioned \"foreign key labels.\"\n</p><p>List and Read UI- These components now call separate stored procedures that properly join the requisite tables to show the appropriate \"foreign key label\" in lieu of the actual value.\n</p><p>I haven\'t done anything with children objects or anything yet.

These unit tests are compatible with and require <a href=\"http://cfunit.sourceforge.net/\">CFUnit</a>. Here\'s a little bit about the reasons behind this.\n</p><p>I originally started fooling around with unit testing because after drinking <a href=\"http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/\">Pragmatic Programmer</a> Kool-Aid, and attending <a href=\"http://www.cfobjective.com/conference/\">cf.Objective</a>, it was the next thing on my list.  I figured I would be pulling them into Squidhead, as it\'s pretty easy to tell if Squidhead worked (the application is either written or not,) but it\'s hard to tell if the created application is working. So I started to write unit tests for my DAO Objects figuring it would be an easy place to start.  Once I got one working, I realized it was relatively rule based and could stand to be generated itself.\n</p><p>What it does is:\n</p><ul><li>Create a mock struct of the record.\n</li><li>Create a mock struct of the record slightly different from the first.\n</li><li>Create a record from the mock record.\n</li><li>Read it back and compares it to the source.\n</li><li>Update it according to the different mock record.\n</li><li>Read it back and compares it to the source.\n</li><li>Delete the record\n</li><li>Read again to make sure the item is gone.\n</li></ul><p>All that is wrapped in a &lt;cftransaction&gt; making sure the thing never happened. Additionally it reads in and honors foreign key constraints.  It\'s got some weaknesses: it doesn\'t like binaries or images; its smalldatetime check is only accurate to the hour; and there are probably more bugs lurking.\n</p><p>Now once I got them working, they were in, but what\'s the point for users of the application? One should expect that the parts work.\n</p><p>So to make this worthwhile I added some logic that will run any test that is in the test directory structure. So if you\'re using Squidhead and looking to dip your feet in the waters of CFunit or unit testing in general here\'s your chance.\n</p><p>If you\'re wondering why <a href=\"http://cfunit.sourceforge.net/\">CFUnit</a>, and not <a href=\"http://www.cfcunit.org/cfcunit/\">CFCUnit</a>, it\'s because as far as I can tell <a href=\"http://www.cfcunit.org/cfcunit/\">CFCUnit</a> requires <a href=\"http://www.mach-ii.com/\">Mach II</a>, and I figured one requirement was better than two.\n</p><p>So if anyone has any suggestion on how to test gateways or dao\'s I\'d be curious.

But I think more interesting is looking at what the ColdFusion team is making easier for you in this release.\n</p><p>ColdFusion has, in my opinion, always been about taking the operations that everyone has to do to build web applications and make them easier. Early versions were focused on making talking to databases easier. ColdFusion MX 6 was about porting the codebase over to Java. You could argue that it was about making ColdFusion easier to work cross platform. That\'s a stretch, so if you prefer we can say it was a rebuilding release. ColdFusion MX 7 was about making interfacing easier. Between &lt;cfreport&gt; and &lt;cfdocument&gt; ColdFusion gained new ways of output data.  Flash Forms was intended to make writing form based interfaces easier. Gateways make ColdFusion easier to interact with in non-traditional, non-browser based ways.\n</p><p>So what does this version of ColdFusion make easier?  I\'ve been searching for an answer to that for a few hours now and I think I have a few answers.\n</p><p>First, from the original <a href=\"http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Scorpio:FAQ\">Scorpio Labs Page</a>:\n</p><ol><li>ColdFusion 8 will allow ColdFusion developers to create richer, more engaging web applications\n</li><li>ColdFusion 8 will provide powerful new insight into server performance and simplify application troubleshooting\n</li><li>ColdFusion 8 will give developers broader platform support and enterprise integration\n</li></ol><p> Here\'s my translation:\n</p><ol><li>ColdFusion 8 makes Web 2.0 Easier\n</li><li>ColdFusion 8 makes Administration Easier\n</li><li>ColdFusion 8 makes selling ColdFusion to the Enterprise easier\n</li></ol><p><strong>ColdFusion 8 makes Web 2.0 easier\n</strong></p><p>Cheesy, unliked, overused and unfortunately for me, necessary, the Web 2.0 moniker is unfortunately here to stay.  It\'s about many things. But I\'ve always liked it, because I\'ve always looked at it not from a technology perspective, (It\'s Ajax, or Flex) but from an authority focus.  Web 2.0 is about user content, not \"authority\" based content. It\'s about users choosing how to consume their applications, not site owners dictating how to consume it.\n</p><p>One could make the argument, that there are only two types of typical, Web 2.0 user data that ColdFusion has to date, not dealt well with. They are Video and Images. Video is still shaking out, and still isn\'t addressed by ColdFusion. (Adobe as a whole has direction on this.) But at least on the image side of things, ColdFusion 8 makes it easier to handle with &lt;cfimage&gt; and the suite of image functions.\n</p><p>It has always been easy to do Flex development against ColdFusion, but now &lt;cfajaxproxy&gt; and the JSON functions are making it easier to do Ajax development against ColdFusion.  This further separates the choice of ColdFusion from the front end used to access it.  This is a good thing, it expands a bit on what they did with 7, but also allows \"ColdFusion and Ajax\" to be said a lot together in press releases and technical news articles.  This is good for us as a community.\n</p><p>ColdFusion 8 does not abandon the interface side of things though. There are a bunch of new display management tags including &lt;cflayoutarea&gt;, &lt;cfpod&gt;, &lt;cfmenu&gt;, &lt;cftooltip&gt;, &lt;cflayout&gt;, &lt;cfmenuitem&gt;, &lt;cfwindow&gt;. This shows that ColdFusion is still trying to make it easier to do things that everyone has to do. This time, they are clearly going after the interactivity of \"Ajaxy\" sites.   Now, in the past, in ColdFusion, these types of interfaces have not always been usable on a forward facing application.  This is no longer the case. Not only do they look completely modern and professional by themselves. But if you don\'t like them, they can be styled by CSS.\n</p><p>Lastly on the Web 2.0 side of things, there is a &lt;cffeed&gt; tag. This makes both creating and consuming RSS or Atom XML feeds much, much easier.  Not much to say about it, this is something that all of us have to do now, ColdFusion makes it easier.\n</p><p><strong>ColdFusion 8 makes Administration Easier\n</strong></p><p>The new ColdFusion Monitor tool is perhaps the best improvement to my job ColdFusion has ever made. The ability to track down an errant template is simply stunning. The ability to kill a running template is beyond stunning, it\'s ginormous.  You can actually see the stack trace of a running template if it\'s causing a problem. You can even see every variable in every conceivable scope in a request.  This is truly stunning.\n</p><p>Even though we central administrators love exercising iron-fisted control over our shared servers, it\'s really nice for Adobe to open up limited capabilities of the administrator to distributed users. I do wish they had made it easier to tie it into a third party directory tool like Active Directory, but I\'ll take what I can get.\n</p><p>Finally the administrator now has more options for tweaking performance. You can set limits on number of simultaneous page requests, CFC calls, Flash Remoting calls, and web service requests. All of these tweaks do make it easier for administrators to control their environments.\n</p><p><strong>ColdFusion 8 makes Selling as an Enterprise Solution easier.\n</strong></p><p>I\'ve never been one to demand Java like features in ColdFusion. However there are a few areas, where it would be nice if more Java like behaviors were exposed.  One case I\'m talking about is file processing.  ColdFusion 8 now lets you parse files line by line, instead of forcing you to load an entire file into memory at once.  But that doesn\'t even mention the addition of native Zip tools, which now exist. Granted you could have always dropped down into Java to handle this stuff, but the more you force that to be a solution for people, the more entry-level programmers that run into walls.\n</p><p>But, ColdFusion 8 doesn\'t just play with Java better. Adobe\'s been hanging out in Redmond.  First ColdFusion 8 can call .Net objects like it can Java classes or CFC\'s. I think a little cooler, is the fact that ColdFusion 8 can talk with Exchange. Granted, I\'m a little sad to be out of an expertise, but happy that everyone can now play with Microsoft\'s groupware offering.  I\'ll probably be saying even more on this feature in the upcoming weeks.  But make no mistake about it, this is hands down the easiest way interact with Exchange other than Outlook. It\'s really, seriously, that good.\n</p><p>There\'s a lot of touting of the performance enhancements to ColdFusion 8. But in addition to just running faster, ColdFusion 8 allows developers to have more control over the performance of their applications through the addition of &lt;cfthread&gt;. This technology will allow developers optimize sequential behaviors like emailing, or rebuilding static files by running them asynchronously. Up until now, the only clean option for asynchronous operations was the Asynchronous CFML Gateway. It does the job, but is a little unwieldy to use if you aren\'t an administrator on the machine.  &lt;Cfthread&gt; doesn\'t replace the Asynchronous CFML Gateway, it just allows another option in the continuum of asynchronous operations.\n</p><p>All in all, developers can now make faster performing applications, on a faster platform, which can talk to many more systems now.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion\n</strong></p><p>This is just the tip of the iceberg.  Every one of these one sentence blurbs represents a feature that deserves its own blog post. (They also probably represent years of developer\'s time.) Additionally there are a ton of features, functions and tags I didn\'t mention.  This is by far the best release of ColdFusion yet.\n</p>  ','ColdFusion 8 Makes It Easier','','publish','open','open','','coldfusion_8_makes_it_easier','','','2007-05-30 22:55:06','2007-05-30 22:55:06','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/coldfusion_8_makes_it_easier',0,'post','',2),(137,1,'2007-06-16 13:26:29','2007-06-16 13:26:29','<p>You may or may not have noticed a little unplanned downtime.

I\'ll be taking over direction of the web portion of the application.\r\n</p><p>My first concern will be the giving the website a direly-needed facelift. To facilitate that we hired <a href=\"http://www.happycog.com/\">Happy Cog</a> to do a kick-ass redesign, that has been sitting unused for awhile.  I\'m going to get that new design up on the site, by October.  As part of that plan, I\'m going to be taking on automation and separation of content from design.   Of course, I won\'t be doing this alone. I\'ve got a new staff of which I\'m in charge\r\n</p><p>The technology that drives the site is Perl.  There are no thoughts on getting rid of all of the Perl, as it\'s needed to talk to the SAS databases on the backend.  I\'ll be adding ColdFusion where it makes sense - mostly in a community feature that we are building.  Additionally I\'m working on what amounts to a domain specific language (in ColdFusion) to automate page construction.  Thanks <a href=\"http://www.pbell.com/\">Peter Bell</a> for turning me on to that whole stuff.\r\n</p><p>It\'s sort of a bittersweet sort of thing.  It\'s the first move for me in awhile that involves complete change, as opposed to just increasing responsibilities. I give up all my safe ColdFusion cache.\r\n</p><p>The job of running our ColdFusion environment and providing ColdFusion leadership will be falling to <a href=\"http://www.lifelikeweeds.com/tech/\">Dave Konopka</a>.   I\'m extremely proud of him, since I hired him, and now he\'s replacing me.\r\n</p><p>While today is my official start date, I have permission to sort of coast through this week and start next Monday.  I\'ll be wrapping up some lose ends from my old job today and tomorrow, and taking a 5 day weekend for Fourth of July holiday.\r\n</p><p>I still intend to post on ColdFusion, and I\'ll still be maintaining <a href=\"http://squidhead.riaforge.org/\">Squidhead</a>. However, I\'m going to generalize the topics a bit. I\'m going to talk a bit about my experience as a client to Happy Cog (awesome in short.)  Also I\'m going to talk about some developer soft skills (like influence), and how to practice them. </p>  ','New Job','','publish','open','open','','new_job','','','2014-10-24 01:09:20','2014-10-24 01:09:20','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/new_job',0,'post','',4),(142,1,'2007-07-11 23:11:46','2007-07-11 23:11:46','<p>I gave a presentation on code reviews to the <a href=\"http://www.phillycfug.org/\">Philly CFUG</a> a few weeks back.  Then my host died, and I never posted this.  I\'ll try and get the presentation up on the site in the next few days.   But two questions arose that I figured I would discuss here:\n</p><ol><li>Do you check the code after the review to make sure developers have made the changes for which the team has asked?\n</li><li>Can developers request a code review?\n</li></ol><p>Both of these speak to a subtler issue.  <em>Does your team want to be adequate or excellent?</em> What about each member, what do they want?  The answer to this question will inform the answer to the previous ones.\n</p><p>Now this isn\'t want of these things where I\'m using reverse psychology to encourage what I want others to do --- \"Well if you want to be only adequate...\" Look, not everyone can be excellent.   I don\'t want to get into a whole discussion on where someone brings up \"Free Markets\" and someone brings up <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_Bergeron\">Harrison Bergeron</a> and then we all get angry at each other.  My brief statement on this is that there is plenty of value contributed by people who are only adequate.\n</p><p>But it\'s going to make a difference with a whole lot of things, including code reviews.  Those that want to be excellent welcome criticism, because the idea of their product being flawed in any way is appalling to them.  It\'s more appalling than letting other people find those flaws.  But really, they like to show off what they\'ve done, and want to be acknowledged by their peers for it too.\n</p><p>On the other hand, those that only want to be adequate don\'t care if something has flaws, as long as it works.  They may try and avoid reviews, but mostly they\'ll tend to be indifferent to the whole process, and will only do it if they are mandated. Unfortunately once it\'s mandated it becomes a perfunctory step for them, a hoop to jump through.  Some of the more militantly adequate will say things like \"Don\'t bother fixing it; let\'s see if we can sneak it past the code review.\"\n</p><p>So, if you have group of developers striving to be excellent, they absolutely will ask for their own reviews (but you might need to let them know they are available) and you won\'t have to check them afterwards.  On the other hand, if your team is on the other end of the spectrum, you might just have to mandate them. Perfunctory code reviews while painful are better than none at all.\n</p><p>As for double checking the code, it comes down to trust.  Do you trust your teammates?  I say err on the side of trust. Code reviews tend to ruffle a few emotional feathers to begin with.  To big brother people afterwards would just add insult to injury.  Trust people until they give a reason not to trust them.  Obviously if you are doing work with sensitive data you may want to evaluate this on your terms.\n</p><p>But if people have violated your trust, you\'re going to be glad you followed the rest of my advice on code reviews.  That way you\'ll have page names and line numbers by which to judge whether or not they kept up their end of the bargain.\n</p><p>This tension between adequate and excellent effects many other aspects of your team.  I\'m thinking you may want to look at this for more than just code reviews. I figured this would be a good place to sneak it in.   </p>  ','On Code Reviews... again','','publish','open','open','','on_code_reviews_again','','','2007-07-11 23:11:46','2007-07-11 23:11:46','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/on_code_reviews_again',0,'post','',2),(143,1,'2007-08-14 22:24:38','2007-08-14 22:24:38','<p>I\'ve been doing a fair amount of work with custom tags and JavaScript DOM manipulation.  One of the things with which I\'ve struggled with is organizing my code.  Do I put the JavaScript in the custom tag?  Do I put it in central .js files?  What if the script I\'ve written will only be called from one custom tag and one custom tag only?\n</p><p>Well I haven\'t worked out all of the answers, but I do have a solution for single use scripts:  Use &lt;<a href=\"http://www.cfquickdocs.com/?sourceid=cfQDSearch1.02&amp;getDoc=cfhtmlhead\">cfhtmhead</a>&gt; to inject the script into the html header from the custom tag.

ColdFusion provides an easy webservice infrastructure you need to run remote Flex applications. These remote Flex applications can just as easily be AIR as Flex.   ColdFusion 8 can now generate rich controlled HTML and JavaScript driven applications.

It shouldn\'t be, especially when it can produce so much of what AIR is made from.\n</p><p>I can envision setting something in Application.cfc like This.publishAsAir = TRUE.

I figured that I would give a longer answer than really works in a comment.\n</p>\n<p>First it\'s important to point out that formal code reviews are part of a suite of quality assurance techniques.  They do not preclude the use of any other, including application design, informal code reviews, testing, etc.\n</p>\n<p>But formal code reviews, a whole bunch of people looking at all of the code, and then having a long meeting discussing it, are relatively expensive.  They take a good deal of time from many people who are probably working on their own code, and incurring the cost of context switching by doing so.  So <strong>my guideline for code reviews is once per major revision of the application</strong>.  Basically, if you spend a few days doing an update on an application that has already been reviewed, then you probably don\'t need a formal review.  If you and a team of developers spend 4 months doing a revision to the code, a formal review is probably in order. Those are the extreme cases; your organization will have to choose where in between to draw the hard fast line.\n</p>\n<p>As for when to do them…  We at Wharton do them <strong>basically right before the application moves from development to production</strong>. This is also the time when we try the application out on the staging server.  The timing is dictated by how we\'ve mandated code reviews. To get your application on our production ColdFusion servers you must go through a code review.\n</p>\n<p>Is that the best time?  I\'m not really sure. I think if you design correctly, unit test, informally review code, and get user feedback from your clients, then it is the right time to do the review.  But we don\'t always do all of that so I get the subtle feeling that earlier might be better, but we\'ll just have to deal with the timing forced by our mandate.\n</p>\n<p>Anyone else have any opinions on this?</p> ','Formal code reviews: When and how often?','','publish','open','open','','formal_code_reviews_when_and_how_often','','','2007-09-10 12:35:21','2007-09-10 12:35:21','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/formal_code_reviews_when_and_how_often',0,'post','',1),(153,1,'2007-09-11 00:05:21','2007-09-11 00:05:21','<p>I\'ve been having an issue with a quick and dirty development server I setup for a project.

It seems that &lt;cfmenu&gt; causes compliance to fail in two ways:\n</p><p>First, it adds JavaScript to the \"OnMouseOver\" and \"OnMouseOut\" attributes of its menu items.  To be compliant, it should be adding them to the \"onmouseover\" and \"onmouseout\" attributes. There\'s an easy fix to this.

Very cool, and will simplify posting <a href=\"http://squidhead.riaforge.org/\" title=\"Squidhead @ Riaforge\">Squidhead</a> updates for me.\n</p><p>2. I caught <a href=\"http://www.dcooper.org/blog/client/index.cfm\" title=\"Damon Cooper\'s BLOG\">Damon Cooper</a> and had a great talk with him. In the course of that he told me something very interesting about the business side of ColdFusion and Adobe. I don\'t think he necessarily wanted it spread, and I\'m going to honor that.  But I encouraged him to show up to the <a href=\"http://www.brianmeloche.com/blog/index.cfm/2007/9/24/Name-change-on-BOF-Promoting-ColdFusion-outside-of-the-CF-Community\" title=\"Name change on BOF: Promoting ColdFusion outside of the CF Community\">BOF session that Brian Meloche is running</a> (and I\'m on the panel,) and let the rest of you in on it.

I actually made it to see the entire Keynote.  There were some cool things to be seen.  For me the highlights, in no particular order, were:\n</p><ul><li>Refactoring and profiling in Flex.  Finally Flex developers have the kind of detailed performance information that ColdFusion developers have had for years.\n</li><li>Hydra ??

With it booked solid this year, if you are in a popular session, and you are late, don\'t expect a seat, or standing room.  I wandered into a few other rooms, but nothing grabbed me.\n</p>\n\n<p>After Lunch I attended the session given by my coworkers.  Before I recommended their session based on knowing them; now I can recommend it on the content.  They did a great job of explaining how and why they converted a VB 6 Trading floor simulator to Flex and ColdFusion.  I highly recommend it: A Virtual Trading Floor: <a href=\"http://adobemax2007.com/na/sessions/locator/session/WD002W\">Bringing Wall Street to the Classroom</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Next I wandered into an Inspire session about the design of Buzzword. It started late and had a lot of technical issues. That was a real shame because Buzzword just looks too good to be true.

I think <a href=\"http://corfield.org/blog/index.cfm/do/blog.entry/entry/MAX_Day_One\">Sean Corfield</a> blogged about it, and I tend to agree with him.  I was fully expecting the crowd to go feral again, but no it was quite cordial.  I think ColdFusion 8 being so rich, and the alpha and beta program being so inclusive was definitely a big part of it.\n</p><p>The second was Selling ColdFusion Outside of the Community. I think the biggest thing I got out of it was the idea that the ColdFusion community has to start swimming in other ponds. We tend to form an echo chamber amongst ourselves.  Then when something negative is said outside the ColdFusion community piles on and just disagrees.  Instead we need to be continuously engaging those outside of the community so that we can build credibility over the long whole.

He made me feel guilty though for continuously looking up his salary for one of my work projects.  It\'s impressive.\n</li><li>Scene 7 does some absurd stuff with dynamic imaging.\n</li><li>Share looks promising\n</li><li>Thermo will be absurd if it does all it promises. Photoshop Composition to Flex application in one click.\n</li><li>Next version of ColdFusion is code named centaur.  My supposition is that it is so named because if angered, it will shoot you with an arrow, and then trample you to death. It does make me feel a little afraid that they will strap a horse\'s body on a shirtless Ben Forta, ala \"Scorpio Man.\" I am disturbed.\n</li></ul><p>I sat through Sean Corfield\'s session on Design Patterns, it was simply tremendous.  I tend to be a fan of Sean\'s but I\'m not exaggerating.  He did a great job of explaining the theory and the concepts behind patterns.  Even though I thought I knew them already, he did bring a new perspective to the whole thing.\n</p><p>I also attended Ryan Stewart\'s session on Air and PDF integration.  It looked interesting, but I have no idea why the hell you would ever do it.\n</p><p>If my day looks a little light, I had a minor problem with something back at home, so I had to skip my first session.  I also had an opportunity to give an ad hoc demo of <a href=\"http://squidhead.riaforge.org/\">Squidhead</a>, so I took it. If for any reason anybody wants a 5 minute demo, drop me a line. I\'m always willing.\n</p><p>I finished up the day at Max Awards and Sneaks Session.  The following really stood out to me:\n</p><ul><li>Visual Communicator is a niche product that will make video presentations very easily. I think it\'s going to be a very cool boon to the vlog space.\n</li><li>Photoshop express is just beyond cool.  Pretty much everything anyone would need to do to a photo can be done in an online client. The demonstrator completely retouched a photo in under 30 seconds. Crazy.\n</li><li>Hemant presented on ColdFusion publishing to Air.  This is something I really wanted for CF since I saw the Air Bus Tour. They\'ve done more with it than I ever thought.  You can do online and offline applications.  Cooler than what I was imagining.\n</li><li>Flash gets skeletons. Very cool.\n</li><li>C++ on Flash leads to Quake on Flash.  Tremendously cool.\n</li><li>Adobe hired that guy who does the dynamic image content resizing.\n</li></ul><p>I ended up skipping the Event, because it didn\'t really cry out to me, I had to prepare something for the CF Boot Camp tomorrow, and I\'m beat from last night.\n</p><p>\n </p>  ','Max 2007 Day 2','','publish','open','open','','max_2007_day_2','','','2007-10-02 21:17:29','2007-10-02 21:17:29','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/max_2007_day_2',0,'post','',0),(170,1,'2007-10-05 08:57:35','2007-10-05 08:57:35','<p>My last day at Max was marred by the technical problems.

I figured it was worth a blog post instead of a comment.\n</p><p>Simply stated, I use ColdFusion because it is the most productive language I have ever worked in.  I have done more, in less time with ColdFusion, than I have ever achieved in any other language.\n</p><p>Over the course of years at my job I have had to do work in ColdFusion, Perl, Php, C++, Python, and Java.  I don\'t claim to know any of them; I just had to work in them.

I\'ve spent more time figuring out how to do the few things I really know in Perl, than I spent learning ColdFusion. Part of that is Perl itself, part of that is the sheer sadistic joy that Perl programmers take in making even their sample code undecipherable to the non-initiated, but most of it can be attributed to ColdFusion\'s true ease of absorption.\n</p><p>I remember something a student interviewing for a co-op position said to me:\n</p><blockquote><p>I wish I hadn\'t learned ColdFusion first.

But that should be considered strength of the language, people want to work in it; people expect other languages to be so accessible.

(Expect a release early next week.)  Oracle was more different from both Microsoft SQL and MySQL than they were from each other.  It got me thinking about the three and their various pros and cons for code generation, and their pros and cons for me doing code generation with stored procedures.  I figured it could make a good blog article. (Or someone could see my post and say \"Hey you didn\'t have to do all that because of the <em>blah</em> command!\")\n</p><p><strong>Microsoft SQL\n</strong></p><p>This was the first one I started with, so the others are being compared to it.  It comes with the built in stored procedure sp_help, which is absolutely brilliant. It gave more information for tables than I ever needed.  It also gives most of the information for a stored procedure that I need.  Although there are a few things lacking which made me have to resort to using sp_helptext, and then parsing the actual stored procedure.   I had to do this to get the number of result sets that a stored procedure returns. (Because if a stored procedure returns more than one record set, Squidhead writes the method to return a structure of queries instead of just a query. ) Also I had to do this to get the metadata of the arguments being passed to a stored procedure.\n</p><p><strong>MySql\n</strong></p><p>Of the three this was the easiest to do.  I had a flash one night (\"just implement sp_help\'s queries in MqSQL\") and it took me less than 24 hours to add it.  Nonetheless I still had to query a lot of system tables directly to get the results I wanted.\n</p><p>There are few other limitations that bug me, but they aren\'t related to code generation.  Things like stored procedures not being able to take default values in their inputs, and views not being able to contain subqueries.  I\'m sure as those features mature though, we\'ll see better results there.\n</p><p><strong>Oracle\n</strong></p><p>Finally, we reach Oracle.  It took me a week of hair pulling, keyboard slamming and muttered curses to get it right.  But finally I did.\n</p><p><em>What I didn\'t like:\n</em></p><p>One has to create a cursor to contain output recordsets for a stored procedure. That\'s so different than the other systems that I wanted to kill someone.  Although, I must confess it makes counting output record sets much easier.\n</p><p>That everything is limited to a name length of 30 characters.  So I had to get creative with how to deal with stored procedures with names like <em>usp_entryToComment_list_foreign_key_labels. </em>The solution I came up with was to abbreviate them and rename them higher up in the Squdihead stack so that the functions have the \"correct\" names.\n</p><p><em>What I liked:\n</em></p><p>Packages.  Packages are sort of like classes or CFC\'s for Oracle operations. The encapsulate code into discreet chunks.  I basically create a package for every table so my stored procs have names like <em>ENTRYPKG.READ</em> which is better in my mind than <em>usp_entry_read</em> as that\'s just a way I use to group and sort stored procedures anyway.\n</p><p>The sheer amount of data in the various data dictionaries.  I don\'t have to parse any code strings to get any metadata.  That\'s much easier.\n</p><p>\"CREATE OR REPLACE.\"  Truly awesome.  Cuts down on the amount of steps I have to do to recreate a stored proc or package.  I wish I had known it exists for MySQL.\n</p><p><strong>Conclusion\n</strong></p><p>It\'s kinda funny, and it may be cognitive dissonance talking, but of the three, I really like Oracle the best for code creation and metadata.

I felt like there had to be a better way than just copying the source of ColdFusion generated HTML files. So I started working with it and came up with a proof of concept project on RIAForge: <a href=\"http://cfair.riaforge.org/\">CF Air Compiler</a>.\n</p><p>I wrote a simple application called \"testapp\" that just binds a CFGrid to the results of a CFC call that returns a CFFeed of <a href=\"http://www.coldfusionbloggers.org/\">coldfusionbloggers</a>.  This is the application that will be packaged into an Air application.\n</p><p>I used CFHttp to grab the ColdFusion page outputted as HTML and move them to a repository. Then I used ReMatch to find all of the used CFIDE javascript files, css files, and images, and copy them to the repository. Then I used ReMatch to grab all of the cfc calls and convert them to fully qualified url calls.\n</p><p>The second part was a little easier.  All it required was wrapping the adt.bat in a CFC wrapper. It just has two methods: certificate and package. They correspond to the options for the adt.bat file.   I used that to compile the application into AIR.\n</p><p>There were a few challenges with it. I haven\'t figured out a way to get to the images used in CSS.  I could just grab them indiscriminately, but I want to do a little better, expect an update after I think about it for a bit. Also the CF JavaScript evidently tries to do some things that violate the security model of the Air Runtime.  It required wrapping the ColdFusion generated html in an iframe.  To read more about the issue, you can check out the <a href=\"http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/AIR:HTML_Security_FAQ\">Air Wiki</a>.\n</p><p>It\'s not perfect code, but I figured I would at least get it out there and maybe someone smarter could take it a little further.

It will create stored procedures that pass queries through this linking table to create relationships between linked tables.\n</p><p>FKCrazy application will use the linking table information to automatically create interface that uses all of the foreign key relationships to add and delete child records.

His dilemma boiled down to the idea that he knew unit testing was one of those mythical \"Good Things\" but he couldn\'t bring himself to do it; it seemed like such a large commitment in time.    I\'ve been thinking more and more about this, and I have come to the conclusion that the time factor in unit testing is actually a myth.  Here\'s why I think so.\n</p><p>Do you write code, and declare it finished when you are done editing it? I hope not. No, you go to your application and test the page you just changed through your browser. If you\'re working on a CFC, maybe you go to a page named test.cfm, on which you have a few CFC calls and a CFDump. You then looked to see if the results you got conform to the results you expected. Did you do that? <strong>Then you just unit tested!</strong> The only difference between that and a formal unit test is that you throw away the test after you were done writing that piece of code.\n</p><p>I propose you formally unit test instead.  Instead of throwing away that test code, put it in a formal testing framework.  You\'ll probably have to change it a bit to get it to work with one of those frameworks, but the learning cost for doing it this way is much, much cheaper that TDD.  Once you do that, you\'ll never have to worry about breaking code again because you hold on to every test you\'ve ever written. Well, okay, you\'ll still worry, but you know as soon as you do it what code you\'ve broken, which is a much better place to be at.\n</p><p>I think a big part of the underlying misconception comes from the fact that most discussions of unit testing include a description of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development\">Test-Driven Development</a> (TDD). That is the system were you figure out how exactly your code should behave, write tests to check for that behavior, then write code that behaves in a way to pass all of your tests.  That <strong>is</strong> going to change the amount of time you spend on development (at least up front, where we tend to myopically be focused.)  More than just a hit in terms of development time, it\'s a hit when it comes to spending the time learning it.  Mind you, I\'m not saying that TDD is bad; it\'s just a paradigm shift, and a big one at that.\n</p><p>BUT that doesn\'t mean that unit testing IS Test-Driven Development; TDD relies on unit tests, not the other way around. Go ahead, write your unit tests after the fact.  No one will know. In fact, many unit tests get written in response to bugs, even when you are doing TDD.\n</p><p>Another misconception is that you have to test everything you do. Some things work better with formal unit testing than others. Yes, with mock objects and development databases you can unit test anything, but that makes the learning curve even steeper. Screw that; don\'t make it harder for yourself.  Small components with a limited range of functions are the easiest to start to work with.  Examples usually include some sort of calculator, or other such item that I never use in actual code.  So here are my recommendations for low hanging unit testing fruit.\n</p><ul><li>Authentication code, specifically that which test usernames and passwords (as opposed to session management)\n</li><li>Utility code, like a phone number formatter, or custom date converter\n</li><li>Parsing code, like code that takes a custom XML format and converts it to a usable format\n</li><li>Problematic code, code that breaks every time you do an update.\n</li></ul><p>So start moving your informal tests to a formal unit tester. Start with the small stuff and don\'t worry about testing everything. And for god\'s sake don\'t think you have to reach for TDD to be successful with unit testing. Somewhere between where you are and where you are heading is a much better place.\n</p><p>In case you want to know more about unit testing and ColdFusion, check out the ColdFusion unit testing frameworks:\n</p><ul style=\"margin-left: 40pt;\"><li><a href=\"http://cfunit.sourceforge.net/\">CFUnit</a>\n		</li><li><a href=\"http://www.cfcunit.org/\">cfcUnit</a>\n		</li><li><a href=\"http://mxunit.org/\">MXUnit</a></li><li><a href=\"http://coldmock.riaforge.org/\">ColdMock</a></li></ul><b>Update</b>: Someone pointed out to me that I had misspelled \"TDD\" as \"TTD.\" Sorry.

I thought I would share the method I\'ve come up with to make it much easier for me to do.\n</p><p>The problem with this type of documentation is that is really easy to do once and then not keep up to date. When coming up with a solution, it had to be repeatable and additive.  You could just read in all that information and recreate dynamically from scratch, but that means you can\'t manually alter the documentation. I was looking for something that would basically just remind/force me to document new options or files.  With that in mind here is what I do:\n</p><ul><li>Assume that I am documenting a set of configuration files\n</li><li>Create an XML file where each file to be documented is a node\n</li><li>Do a directory list of the files to be documented\n</li><li>Grab the name of each file\n</li><li>Check to see if a node currently exists in the XML for each file.\n</li><li>If not I add a node named after the file\n</li><li>Create blank sub nodes for \"documentation,\" \"notes,\" or \"required\" or whatever\n</li></ul><p>When that pass is done:\n</p><ul><li>I scan the XML\n</li><li>I check for blank sub nodes.\n</li><li>If any exit I throw an error\n</li></ul><p>I then add this process to my ANT build for the project. Now every time I go to build the project, the documentation gets scanned, added to if needed, and I am prevented from moving forward until I document new changes.\n</p><p>This turned documentation for me from an incomplete mess of a task that takes two hours or so every few weeks to 5 minute maintenance step every time I build.</p>  ','Automating Documentation','','publish','open','open','','automating_documentation','','','2008-02-08 09:29:16','2008-02-08 09:29:16','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/automating_documentation',0,'post','',4),(193,1,'2008-02-08 12:09:25','2008-02-08 12:09:25','<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">This is a follow up to the post <a href=\"http://www.numtopia.com/terry/blog/archives/2008/02/automating_documentation.cfm\">Automating Documentation.</a>  <a href=\"http://www.thecrumb.com/\">Jim Priest</a> wanted to see example code, and I\'m happy to oblige.\n</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">For this example, I am sharing the code for documenting \"steps\" in <a href=\"http://squidhead.riaforge.org/\">Squidhead</a>. Steps are operations that do one thing, like generate stored procs, or ant scripts, or email developers. They are powered by cfm templates in a specific folder.  Once there they can be referenced through in the project\'s config file.

(It was down a long time during a routine patch and reboot due to extra stuff in a Microsoft Tuesday patch.) In trying to troubleshoot the issue, one of the administrators saw errors in the event logs coming from the ColdFusion ODBC Agent.\n</p><p>We are using default driver for Microsoft SQL Server in the drop down on the Data Sources page. Therefore, we were using JDBC driver and weren\'t impacted by the ODBC error.  The error message was a red herring.  It took focus away from the real problem, namely that the database server hadn\'t come back online yet.\n</p><p>Going further, as far as I can tell all of the defaults on that page are JDBC drivers, with the exceptions of \"ODBC Socket\" and \"Microsoft Access\".  According to this Damon\'s comment on <a href=\"http://nagpals.com/blog/index.cfm/2007/3/6/Using-JDBC-drivers-for-Microsoft-Access\">this blog post</a>, the \"Microsoft Access with Unicode\" doesn\'t even need the ODBC driver.

So if you were to take the history of my SVN commits, they make pretty decent release notes.  The trick is to grab them and automatically turn them into documentation.\n</p><p>SVN makes this pretty easy.  It takes one command to grab all of the changes.

Before ExportReports, a Basecamp user could request a backup of their site, and receive an XML dump of their project.  Now, through our site, a user can ask for PDF exports at will.

Many other voices have chimed in on this. But I feel like I have something different to say.\n</p><p>Regardless of the any business gains that Blue Dragon gets from doing this, I don\'t think the <strong>community</strong> will get a tremendous benefit from this.\n</p> <p>You see, there is this stream of logic that goes something like this:\n</p><ul><li>ColdFusion has a small market share, and it is shrinking\n</li><li>ASP.NET, PHP, and Ruby (on Rails) have much more of the market\n</li><li>PHP and Ruby (on Rails) are Open Source and free.\n</li><li>ASP.NET is zero cost on top of something else we forget you have to pay for\n</li><li>ColdFusion would gain market share if it was open source.\n</li><li>By \"open source\" we actually mean \"free.\"\n</li></ul><p>I think this line of reasoning comes from people that base their request for opening up ColdFusion on what they <strong>think</strong> the rest of the web development world wants.  They think it is all about cost. There are reasons that other people prefer PHP or Ruby (on Rails) or ASP.Net.  Not all of those reasons have to do with ColdFusion\'s cost.\n</p><ul><li>Some people just have to do many small CRUD apps. For just this specific subset of CRUD apps, Ruby on Rails is a better solution than a default install of ColdFusion.\n</li><li>Some people want to build around one or several of the many open source applications written in PHP. Why use ColdFusion when you just have to write a few extra PHP pages.\n</li><li>Some people have to work with proprietary Microsoft technology. With the exception of Exchange, ColdFusion isn\'t as good as ASP.Net for that.\n</li><li>Alright - some people don\'t like proprietary solutions of any kind. At least we know they\'re not using ASP.Net.\n</li></ul><p>I think the ways in which ColdFusion can build inroads around these solution-needs are:\n</p><ul><li>More community support around the existing scaffolding solutions for ColdFusion\n</li><li>More open source solutions written IN ColdFusion\n</li><li>More Adobe support around proprietary interfaces that draw people away from ColdFusion.\n</li><li>Acceptance of the fact that just because some people won\'t buy proprietary solutions doesn\'t mean they shouldn\'t exist.\n</li></ul><p>Notice \"open source ColdFusion\" wasn\'t on that list.  I don\'t think it ever will be.\n</p><p>I don\'t know which of the reasons holds the biggest opportunity for ColdFusion to gain market share. You\'d need to do surveys and ask current and defecting customers a whole bunch of questions.  That sounds like a job for the marketing department of Adobe.  Hmmm.   Didn\'t Adobe add tags for getting information about database\'s schema a little easier?  Didn\'t they fund <a href=\"http://www.riaforge.org/\">RIAForge</a>?  Didn\'t they add code for calling .NET assemblies and the CFExchange tags?\n</p><p>I think Adobe has already decided which customers they are going to go after.   Right or wrong, they\'ve stuck with selling their current solution, and tailoring it to get those three groups. I think what happens to Blue Dragon, ColdFusion, and market share will do a good job of sorting out who\'s right here.  I\'m betting on Adobe.\n</p><p><em>Oh, why did I write \"Ruby (on Rails)\" everywhere?  I get annoyed when people fail to understand the distinction between the language and the framework. That being said, I think that Ruby on Rails is the right thing to call the ColdFusion competitor, as it is the entire solution that attracts web developers to it, not just the language. As a further aside, I think the total solution that ColdFusion provides is the special sauce of ColdFusion, not just the language.\n</em></p><p>\n </p> ','Yawn, Blue Dragon Goes Open Source','','publish','open','open','','yawn_blue_dragon_goes_open_source','','','2008-03-11 00:35:15','2008-03-11 00:35:15','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/yawn_blue_dragon_goes_open_source',0,'post','',14),(202,1,'2008-03-11 23:45:10','2008-03-11 23:45:10','<p>Or I would be if you are subscribed to the <a href=\"http://www.coldfusionweekly.com/\">ColdFusion Weekly Podcast</a>.\n</p><p>I got to participate in the CF_Rountable, a new format for the show where a bunch of ColdFusion community members talk about various geeky topic fodder.

So the keynote was cut a little short.  That was disappointing, but thankfully, no permanent damage was done.  Jason was just on the cusp of announcing that ColdFusion was going to an open process for development, getting a public bug tracker among other things.  This is very promising!\n</p><p>I wandered into Kurt Wiersma\'s presentation on <a href=\"http://www.cfobjective.com/sessions_process_tools.cfm\">Setting up a Solid Level Local Development Environment</a>. I have to admit, I was mostly going to check up on what he recommended, because I had written an article in Fusion Authority Quarterly about the same subject.  I had the fear that I was completely wrong or something.  Good news for me, Kurt\'s presentation recommended similar things where we overlapped.  His presentation was really solid, with really good recommendations on how to setup your environment.  I\'m not just saying that because I agree with him, but because he gave really good tips and pointers for configuring your environment.  Definitely pull down the presentation if he puts it online.\n</p><p>I skipped the second morning session to work on my presentation.\n</p><p>After lunch I went to <a href=\"http://www.cfobjective.com/sessions_process_tools.cfm\">Agile Bootcamp</a> by John Paul Ashenfelter. This was a session that I was especially looking forward and it didn\'t disappoint. John\'s a great speaker. If I got nothing else out of it, I finally understand tags versus trunks in Subversion now. Additionally, in 20 minutes he did more to help me learn Selenium then I had after a week of trying to do it on my own. In total even if you knew some of this stuff ahead of time, it was extremely worthwhile.\n</p><p>I finished up my day torn between a few great presenters, but decided that I have never had a chance to hear Peter Bell speak and wanted to, so I went to his <a href=\"http://www.cfobjective.com/sessions_architecture.cfm\">Software Product Lines</a> lecture.

The presenter/performer is concerned about the appearance of humility.\n</p><p>Both ignore a greater truth in the interaction: <strong>Someone has said something nice to you, and you are immediately telling them they are wrong! </strong>Even if they don\'t directly perceive this, it can leave them with a bad taste in their mouth.\n</p><p>So what do you do?  Say <em>\"Thank you,\"</em> that\'s it. Leave the self examination stuff where it belongs, in your head.

Model-Glue 2 broke me of my resistance to frameworks, it made me willing to use them. Model-Glue 3 just makes me want to use Model-Glue 3. I really like seeing things being brought in from the RoR writing process. (Ask for something, a shell gets created, then modify it.) I can\'t wait until it\'s more documented and ready to go, as I can\'t consider myself an expert Model-Glue user.\n</p><p>Then I wandered into Mike Brunt\'s session on <a href=\"http://www.cfobjective.com/sessions_platform.cfm\">Clustering and Distributing ColdFusion Applications</a>.  I really wanted to hear Mike talk, because he is one of the few public voices on server administration in the community. I admit, I think my brain is full.  But I can\'t really think it, because my brain is full.  I did like the tip to use the default install of ColdFusion in multiserver as an admin node.\n</p><p>Despite that, I went to Jason Delmore\'s <a href=\"http://www.cfobjective.com/sessions_architecture.cfm\">Building Hybrid Applications with ColdFusion and Java</a>. I got a lot out of this session when he gave it a few years ago at MAX. It\'s definitely geeky stuff for people who want to know how things are running under the covers.  But this type of knowledge is really great to have when you are trying to figure out what\'s going on when your application misbehaves.  The part about String buffers was worth the entire session.  If you deal with large string operations, take a longer look at this if the presentation comes out.  I need to implement this stuff immediately.\n</p><p>Finally the closing section was a nice ending beat to the conference.  It impresses me just how much passion the people in the room have to this niche of the professional world.</p>  ','cf.Objective 2008 Day 3','','publish','open','open','','cfobjective_2008_day_3','','','2008-05-04 22:12:33','2008-05-04 22:12:33','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/cfobjective_2008_day_3',0,'post','',1),(212,1,'2008-05-05 16:03:16','2008-05-05 16:03:16','<p>It\'s over and few things need stating:\n</p><ul ><li>cf.Objective repeated its performance as the awesomest conference ever\n</li><li>The entire steering committee out did themselves in terms of content and speakers.\n</li><li>Once again, the cf.Objective not only delivers great lectures from the experts, but the ability to actually interact with them.\n</li></ul><p>Almost everything this year was better:\n</p><ul><li>Room scheduling - I saw no ad hoc room changes due to audience size.\n</li><li>Power distribution - there were many outlets available in every room\n</li><li>Venue - I thought the rooms and facilities were just as good as last year, but the staff was much more helpful.\n</li></ul><p>On the con side:\n</p><ul><li>Wireless was terrible.\n</li><li>The food was hit or miss.\n</li></ul><p>Neither of those two facts was, in any way, a real problem for me.

The AIR Software Development Kit is available for free. How does Adobe make any money from this technology?\n</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Kevin goes on to answer, read the whole article for his exact answer, but basically it comes down to the fact that Adobe uses it\'s free products as a loss leader to encourage purchases of their other technologies including tooling and servers. He specifically includes ColdFusion in that.\n</p><p>I think this is another pointer to the fact that Adobe probably won\'t be open sourcing or making free ColdFusion anytime in the near future.

I had trouble determining the correct test to write, and finally did so. I thought that perhaps someone else might benefit from an exploration of testing strategy.\n</p><p>As you might know, we create pdf\'s using ColdFusion for <a href=\"http://www.exportreports.com/\">ExportReports.com</a>. One of the new features we are adding is the ability to set the page size (legal, letter, A4&#133; etc.) As page size is a feature, I need to test it.  So I need to create a pdf file then determine what its page size is.  At first I explored &lt;cfpdf&gt; and its ability to get at PDF metadata.  No joy - it turned out that page size isn\'t one of the things returned in the metadata.   Then I looked at &lt;cfpdf&gt;\'s ability to get thumbnails of the pages in the pdf.   I could use &lt;cfimage&gt; to get the information about height and width of the image files, put that was in pixels and hard to translate to inches. (I tried assuming 300dpi, it did not yield good results.) Then it dawned on me that ratio of height to width could yield helpful answers.  I found the dimensions in millimeters for the various page types, created ratios from them, and compared them to the ratio of the dimensions of the thumbnails.  Then I had to correct a bit for precision, and it yielded me a solution.  Here\'s what it looked like in code:\n</p><p>\n		<span style=\"font-family: Consolas; font-size: 10pt;\"><span style=\"color: gray;\">&lt;!--- Grab a processable view of the pdf ---&gt;</span><br /><span style=\"color: maroon;\">&lt;cfpdf</span><span style=\"color: black;\">\n			</span><span style=\"color: maroon;\">action=</span><span style=\"color: blue;\">\"thumbnail\"</span><span style=\"color: black;\"><br /></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Over the course of the past few weeks, my team has grown dependent on Unfuddle as part of our work flow, and I have grown to absolutely love the service.\n</p><p>One of the only caveats is that we aren\'t used to relying on outside services for that sort of mission critical part of our environment.  So the thought of our information out a server that we didn\'t control started disaster recovery talk, and one of the important things to make sure we had was a backup of our content from Unfuddle.  Now, they were one step ahead of us, they include the ability to ask for backups, which include svn dumps, as part of the service. They go one step further, and actually have this as part of their API.\n</p><p>Being the automator that I am, I automated requesting a backup, checking to see if it was finished, and downloading it, so that we now have fresh copies of our data every week. In the course of doing that I created an Unfuddle.cfc that provided hooks into their API.  I decided to share it, and the backup application on <a href=\"http://www.riaforge.org/\">RIAForge</a> for a few reasons:\n</p><ul><li>I know a few CF\'ers are using Unfuddle.\n</li><li>I figured some non-CF\'ers might want to functionality enough to give CF a try\n</li></ul><p>It\'s not a complete implementation yet.  I\'ve gotten done as much I need for the backup application.  I\'m then starting to fill out the features.  If there is a feature you would like from the Unfuddle API, please let me know.  In any case, check out <a href=\"http://unfuddlecfc.riaforge.org/\">Unfuddlecfc</a>.\n</p><p>Another thing I have to say is that the Unfuddle guys did an awesome job writing this API (at least as far as I\'ve coded).  There are just all of these little details that make it very easy to use. It\'s really easy to pass queries, and options to the various REST commands, because it takes those options a few different ways.  The other thing they did was make sure that responses are very uniform, so it was really easy to write rules for processing their results.  Between the API and the app itself, the crew at Unfuddle is a real credit to Ruby on Rails. </p> ','Unfuddlecfc','','publish','open','open','','unfuddlecfc','','','2008-09-30 16:58:00','2008-09-30 16:58:00','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/unfuddlecfc',0,'post','',2),(231,1,'2008-10-29 13:19:11','2008-10-29 13:19:11','<p>I ran into a problem with our standard configuration for web servers, and couldn\'t find the real solution documented anywhere, so here it does.\n</p><p>We run our ColdFusion servers on dual node Windows Network Load Balancing (NLB) servers running in IGMP multicast mode. We run it on machines with two network cards. The cluster address is on one NIC and the nodes answer on another. It\'s the configuration we\'ve come to like after years of working with NLB and port flooding and other anomalies.\n</p><p>I\'m installing a new production NLB cluster for Knowledge@Wharton.  To future proof it, and avoid upgrades down the road, I\'m going with ColdFusion 8 64 bit on Windows 2008 64 bit. I ran through the configuration steps that I always take setting up an NLB cluster, and it worked&#133; sort of.  See the cluster address answered if you called it from another host on the subnet that the cluster was installed on. However, if you were off subnet it didn\'t answer.  This is suboptimal for a web server.\n</p><p>I worked with our networking team, and they figured out (from this post: <a href=\"http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/winserverClustering/thread/0afdb0fc-2adf-4864-b164-87e24451f875/\">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/winserverClustering/thread/0afdb0fc-2adf-4864-b164-87e24451f875/</a> ) that if you added a gateway to the cluster NIC, it would work. This is counter to the way NLB has worked before, and generally not best practice. So we opened a support case with Microsoft. After a few tries, I finally got an engineer that was an expert on NLB in 2008, he had the exact cause and solution for this problem: by default IP Forwarding is not enable in Windows 2008.  This is the feature of Windows networking that, in the context of NLB, allows responses to requests sent to one NIC to be routed out the other. It\'s fixed by using one specific command line option.\n</p><p> (Make sure you are using a command prompt with administrative privlidges)\n</p><p>netsh interface ipv4 set int \"[name of the NIC]\" forwarding=enabled\n</p><p>That\'s it.\n</p>  ','Windows 2008 NLB with 2 NICs','','publish','open','open','','windows_2008_nlb_with_2_nics','','','2008-10-29 13:19:11','2008-10-29 13:19:11','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/windows_2008_nlb_with_2_nics',0,'post','',2),(232,1,'2008-11-06 12:29:00','2008-11-06 12:29:00','<p>Welcome all to my new blog.  In the next few weeks I imagine I\'ll be posting on:<br />•    the happenings at MAX 2008<br />•    A few cool new features for Squidhead<br />•    A few things I learning on a high pressure pro-bono freelance job that ended on November 4th 2008.</p> ','Welcome to TerrenceRyan.com','','publish','open','open','','welcome-to-terrenceryan-com','','','2008-11-06 12:29:00','2008-11-06 12:29:00','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/welcome-to-terrenceryan-com',0,'post','',1),(233,1,'2008-11-10 14:36:56','2008-11-10 14:36:56','<p>I got an opportunity to volunteer for the Obama campaign and donated some custom web application building to the effort.  In case you\'re turned off by politics, this post isn\'t going to be about politics, it\'s more about the environment and technical challenges that I experienced.  Finally, I want to make it clear that I am only claiming a teeny, tiny part in the effort. The campaign was won by a lot of people working a lot harder for a lot longer, they deserve a lot of respect, even if you don\'t agree with them.\n</p>\n<p>About three weeks before Election Day a call for volunteers came my way from a co-worker. The Voter Protection division of the Obama campaign in Pennsylvania needed someone who had experience working with databases.\n</p>\n<p>After talking with them for awhile we distilled down their problems. They had about 6000 volunteer lawyers willing to work 9000 polling places to protect voters from various threats (some of it malfeasance, but more normally a failure of someone to grasp the full set of election law as it pertains to a particular voter.)  They were making these assignments by combining information from a central web application with information collected in the field. They were using copies of an Excel spreadsheet they made every night for in-the-field collection.  The guy I was working for had to make that spreadsheet every night, and it was obvious that he needed a better way, but he couldn\'t just drop what he was doing and knuckle down and do it.\n</p>\n<p>I, having no other responsibilities to the campaign, could.\n</p>\n<p>In the end, from an application standpoint it was pretty basic: 2 tables, 1 linking table for the many to many relationship (multiple volunteers could be at multiple poling locations.)  I pointed <a href=\"http://www.numtopia.com/terry/blog/archives/2007/11/squidhead_updates_and_new_features.cfm\">Squidhead in fkcrazy (foreign key crazy) mode</a> and it did all the work for me. I had to do some custom tweaking of the app, but I tried to do as little of that as possible because I knew that there would be schema changes. I just had that sense.  Then over the next few days I responded to various and sundry schema changes (I told me so).\n</p>\n<p>It was a great experience, mostly because as a small database driven application with many schema changes and not a lot of custom interface work, it was the perfect use case for Squidhead. It reminded me just how useful code generation can be.\n</p>\n<p>I finished up work for it in time for the last two weeks of the campaign.  The local volunteer staff would use my application to make assignments.  Then before Election Day they would upload their work to the central campaign to integrate with the incident tracking system they had.\n</p>\n<p>Over the next few days, I didn\'t think about it much, I the usage stats, and got a note from my host which noticed the spike in traffic (but coolly forgave the overage – <a href=\"http://yohost.com/\">YoHost</a> Rocks!). All in all I just watched the final days of election coverage, and hoped all was well.\n</p>\n<p>Around 11:30 on Election night I got a text message inviting me to the local victory party.  I figured I should go, because with all of the hype, emotion, and passion of this past election season it seemed like an awesome opportunity. I got there; met up with the guy I worked for; and got introduced around.  It went something like this:\n</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 36pt\"><em>Hey, I\'d like you to meet Terry Ryan.\n</em></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 36pt\"><em>Hi, Terry. (Polite, but unexcited)\n</em></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 36pt\"><em>He\'s the guy who ran the Numtopia application\n</em></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 36pt\">Followed by me getting hugged by a total stranger.\n</p>\n<p>I, uncomfortable, dismissed some of the praise because the app was pretty ugly, only to get some very informed feedback:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>We had a pretty app from Chicago, yours did what we needed it to do\n</em></li>\n<li><em>We couldn\'t even search the other one by \"ward\", which made it useless in Philadelphia\n</em></li>\n<li><em>Yours was blindingly fast compared to the one from Chicago\n</em></li>\n<li><em>And didn\'t you write it in 3 days?\n</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I have never been quite so thoroughly thanked and appreciated for my work ever. It was an awesome feeling. I am so gratified that I could use my skills to do something for the cause.\n</p>\n<p>Now, I saw the \"application for voter protection from Chicago\" and I have to say it was very beautiful, with a whole lot of cool features.<em>\n		</em>I don\'t want to knock those guys, as dealing with thousands of records on the State level and hundreds of thousands of records on the National level are two different things.  Additionally, dealing with the demands of 1 office as opposed to 50 also changes the game.  But I will say that in 3 days, 1 volunteer developer using ColdFusion replaced an application built over weeks by a team of paid developers using PHP. (I don\'t know the specifics.)\n</p>\n<p>I took a few lessons from my experience:\n</p>\n<p><strong>The constraint of a drop-dead-deadline can be incredibly freeing.</strong>  I didn\'t have time to think about things trying to come up with elegant solutions.  Some of my solutions were using query of queries in a way I would never recommend.  But I needed to get it done because November 4<sup>th</sup> was unavoidable.\n</p>\n<p><strong>Compelling User Interfaces aren\'t always the answer</strong>. Squidhead creates usable and accessible but ugly UI components from the get go. They\'re meant to be styled by custom CSS.  That they were usable was the users\' only concern. They didn\'t care that it wouldn\'t win a design award. Their major concerns were speed and predictability.\n</p>\n<p><strong>Squidhead is better than I think it is</strong>.  I\'ve been down on Squidhead for awhile as it doesn\'t have the user base that <a href=\"http://www.transfer-orm.com/\">Transfer</a>, <a href=\"http://www.reactorframework.com/\">Reactor</a>, or <a href=\"http://cfcgenerator.riaforge.org/\">Illudium</a> has. <a href=\"http://www.mischefamily.com/nathan/\">Nathan Mische</a> been telling me that the stuff he wants to add will help get the word out, and I think he\'s right.  However, it did stuff that I didn\'t originally think it could do, or thought it would be hard to make it do. It worked flawlessly.  I just need to get the word about how powerful the foreign key introspection is.\n</p>\n<p>Working for the campaign was an awesome opportunity.  It was pretty fulfilling compared to other volunteer political work I\'ve done. But what\'s more, it has pushed me to do a bit more, and have a little more confidence about the work I can produce. Expect to hear some new features coming out about Squidhead in the next few weeks.  </p> ','Working for the Obama Campaign','','publish','open','open','','working-for-the-obama-campaign','','','2008-11-10 14:36:56','2008-11-10 14:36:56','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/working-for-the-obama-campaign',0,'post','',2),(234,1,'2008-11-11 13:39:00','2008-11-11 13:39:00','<p>Today the Knowledge@Wharton tech team put into the wild something I\'ve been working on for some time: a new platform for <a href=\"http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/\">Knowledge@Wharton</a> and <a href=\"http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/india/\">India Knowledge@Wharton</a>.  The new platform consists of the following:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Windows 2008 Load Balanced Cluster\n</li>\n<li>Core Services Code Base and ColdFusion 8\n</li>\n<li>Layout\n</li>\n<li>Development and Publishing System\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Windows 2008 Load Balanced Cluster\n</strong></p>\n<p>We built a two node cluster using Windows 2008 64 bit Enterprise Version. One node is a VMware instance, and one node is a blade server. I like this configuration as I only have to worry about a machine warrantee on one node, but I have the backup of a hardware-based node if something goes wrong with our VMware installation.  Not that such an event is likely; I would prefer not to tempt fate.\n</p>\n<p>I\'ve mentioned it before that we don\'t use Load Balancing so much for load as for availability. By having dual node clusters for our production environments we buy ourselves zero downtime patch cycles. We did have a little <a href=\"/blog/post.cfm/windows_2008_nlb_with_2_nics\">trouble getting NLB on Windows 2008 working</a>, but we did get it fixed after talking to Microsoft support.\n</p>\n<p>The upgrade went really smoothly.  I\'m used to using cnames to handle this sort of move, but due to SSL considerations knowledge.wharton.upenn,edu has an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_record\">A record</a>.  The easiest way to make the change was to add the new nodes to the existing Windows 2003 cluster, then remove the windows 2003 nodes. It worked like a charm, and I think it will be my new procedure as it was shockingly easy.\n</p>\n<p><strong>Core Services Code Base and ColdFusion 8\n</strong></p>\n<p>In looking to upgrade Knowledge and India Knowledge to ColdFusion 8 I had to touch a lot of the code. Not so much because there was a problem with it, but because we wanted to take advantage of new features. In the course of doing that I discovered that the main Knowledge site and India contained a lot of duplicated code between them.  I was able to centralize it and then add new features to both sites.  There are two main features that I added to the central code base: cached queries and search driven folksonomy.\n</p>\n<p>Caching the queries was pretty trivial.  I rolled my own instead of using an existing caching framework or native ColdFusion caching.  I wanted an easy to flush cache system that didn\'t need to be too complex.  Because of the highly normalized nature of the database, I couldn\'t get a tremendous performance boost through indexing; caching however has proven to be the correct solution by a long shot. It makes sense; we have a lot of frequently read, rarely written data here.  I\'m just surprised at the overall boost to the site we accomplished with one fix.\n</p>\n<p>\"Search driven folksonomy\" is a cool idea that my boss Dave had back in 2006. It was running for awhile then got deactivated for some reason and I just re-implemented it. Basically, instead of having people manually tag articles, instead use our search referral keywords to tag articles automatically, then when an article hits some sort of critical number of hits for a keyword to an article that keyword becomes a tag on that article. We\'ve enabled the collection piece for now and will enable tag display once we tweak the model a bit after getting some real data.\n</p>\n<p><strong>Layout\n</strong></p>\n<p>I can\'t take credit for the look and feel.  This was done by Dave and a co-worker, Sanjay.  They worked on pushing Knowledge to a more current centered layout, along with a few other tweaks to accommodate advertizing without compromising the editorial content.\n</p>\n<p>The one thing I contributed here was a custom tag that converted an article to an array of </p>\n<p> tags. Then the article custom tag was able to wrap around other custom tags and display them in the flow of the article at set positions in the array, or the next pre-determined location in the array, or at the end.  It made for a very flexible way to showcase link suggestion or article tools within the flow of the article thereby freeing up space for the aforementioned ads.\n</p>\n<p><strong>Development and Publishing System\n</strong></p>\n<p>This was the hardest to tackle part of the whole thing. Because I was asking people to change the way they worked. But Dave and Sanjay were open to it, especially since I promised that it would make their lives much easier after a little bit of pain.\n</p>\n<p>The old model consisted of doing development on a shared development server with no source control.  Changes were manually pushed to production. Occasional copies were made of the code. Communication about changes were ad-hoc and not necessarily as frequent as the changes.\n</p>\n<p>The new model pushes development to local installs of ColdFusion. Source control is handled through Subversion hosted on <a href=\"http://unfuddle.com/\">Unfuddle.com</a>. Communication about changes occurs on every update, thanks to Unfuddle\'s notification system. The shared development server gets automatically updated from the trunk on every svn commit via svn commit hooks.  Then to move the code around I have one click ANT tasks that handle updating development from Subversion, updating staging from development, updating production from stage, and a unified task that can does all of the updating in sequence (subversion to dev to stage to production in one click with a warning that you should only do this if you are sure about it.) All of this is to accommodate all of the various publishing needs we have.    I then wrote ColdFusion that calls the ANT tasks, and an AIR application that calls the ColdFusion.  This gives us a one-click publishing tool that we can run from a browser or a desktop application.\n</p>\n<p>We replaced one node of the cluster yesterday, fixed a few bugs, then replaced the other node today - all in all, a very smooth upgrade.  I\'m extremely happy. It\'s a lot to accomplish in 3 months.  Mostly, after years of working on very backend systems which never get touched by users, it\'s extremely gratifying to work on something that I can show off.</p>','Knowledge@Wharton Upgrades','','publish','open','open','','knowledge-wharton-upgrades','','','2008-11-11 13:39:00','2008-11-11 13:39:00','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/knowledge-wharton-upgrades',0,'post','',0),(235,1,'2008-11-16 15:22:42','2008-11-16 15:22:42','<p>Hey!

I, of course, woke up late and missed the bus to Adobe HQ.  I blame Ryan Stewart.  However I got there eventually and got to participate.\n</p>\n<p>It started with the VP of Education, Peter Issacson, talking about Adobe\'s outreach to the Education sector.\n</p>\n<p>Some cool facts that came out early:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Job Demand for Flash Knowledge is up 35,000% over the past 3 years\n</li>\n<li>Job Demand for Flex Knowledge up 4500%\n</li>\n<li>Job Demand for Ajax is up 20,000%\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Those aren\'t typos. For Education, these numbers mean that Adobe has to get in an engage the Academic sector to get people trained in these tools.  This event was designed to impress upon us that Adobe knows it, and are working on it, and are looking to those in Education to help them out.\n</p>\n<p>Next we heard from Steven Kurtz talking about his program at the Rochester Institute of Technology.  He talked about the New Media Interactive Development Program at RIT.  They take design students and teach them ActionScript among other programming languages. One of the success stories from that program Colin Doody talked about his experiences in it.   It sounds like an amazing academic program as it combines both programming and design into one track.  It\'s pretty rare in the academic community. It\'s also interesting as the problems that these students deal with are supposed to be addressed by Thermo.\n</p>\n<p>Next we heard from Ozge Samanci from Georgia Tech.  She talked about the School of Literature, Communication, and Culture. It\'s yet another program that is turning out Adobe Tools and technology experts. The program sounds like a cross between a Liberal Arts education and a design and programming education.  There appears to be a pattern to these programs.  They all are programs that didn\'t exist when I was in college, but I would have loved to do.\n</p>\n<p>Also from Georgia Tech, we heard from Manvesh Vyas, who is doing work with surface computing. It was beyond me to describe, he actually talked about how surface computing worked at a low level. He also went into the \"multi-touch\" problem.  Basically, is every finger a mouse, or it your hand the mouse? It seems very difficult.  The part I did get was that they built a bridge between his surface computing and Actionscript, and are publicly sharing the code in a bit which means to me that Flash might get into the surface computing space sooner than later.\n</p>\n<p>Next up was Mike McKean, who is professor of Journalism, who talked about the Reynolds Journalism Institute at the University of Missouri.  He challenged students from several disciplines to create AIR apps with the broad focus of having to do with Journalism in some way.  The thing that impressed me about it was that it was a great proof of how AIR can really make desktop development accessible to people who would never have created applications before.\n</p>\n<p>After Lunch we received a presentation from SoDA, or the Society of Digital Agencies. They\'re trying to advance the design industry \"through best practices, education and advocacy.\" Basically they are design employers who want Higher Education to pump out graduates that they can hire.\n</p>\n<p>Next was Salesforce.com, which I was totally expecting to be a little dull.  I was shocked, the speaker was very engaging. I still don\'t get Salesforce.com, but he had my attention. His talk was mostly about cloud computing and his company\'s offering in that space.\n</p>\n<p>I\'ve heard many people talk about Salesforce offerings before, and like I said above, I still don\'t quite get it.  But my understanding of it seems to be a provided enterprise CRM with an complete web service API that basically allows you to do anything on the backend system.  Like I said it was interesting, but I\'m not sure the tie in to Higher Ed.\n</p>\n<p>The final section of the day was a break out section where educators that are teaching Adobe products talked about their experience with it.  One compelling thing I heard, was Bill Bain\'s point that Flash as having both a design and a programming component can be a Rosetta stone for getting developers into design and designers into development.\n</p>\n<p>All in all, it was a very cool session, and I\'m excited to see what Adobe continues to do to interface into the Higher Education industry. </p> ','MAX 2008 Day 0','','publish','open','open','','max-2008-day-0','','','2008-11-16 16:23:16','2008-11-16 16:23:16','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/max-2008-day-0',0,'post','',2),(237,1,'2008-11-17 11:06:12','2008-11-17 11:06:12','<p>It\'s Day 1, and I actually made it to the Keynote on time.

Which means the NFL, NBA, and MLB are all on Flash.\n</p>\n<p>Michael Zimbalist from the New York Times talked about what the NYT is doing with Air. They\'re working on a new version of their News Reader. Coolest part of this presentation - a giant picture of Wallace Shawn looking down at the crowd at Max. But more than that, they\'ve really done a great job of creating an AIR version of the NYT that grasps the advantages of an actual newspaper with the advantages of an Air app.\n</p>\n<p>Then in the middle of talking about a California Museum application, Maria Shriver showed up.\n</p>\n<p>Kevin then showed off an Adobe application called \"Tour de Flex\" that shows off the underlying code to interact with various other cloud services.\n</p>\n<p>Once again our friends from Salesforce.com were talking about their cloud services. I think through sheer cognitive dissonance I\'ve become a fan.  \"I\'m listening to salesforce.com speak again, I must like them.\" In fairness, they really are on the cutting edge of being an enterprise company that gets SOA.\n</p>\n<p>Nigel Pegg came up to talk about Cocomo. He showed off an application that allows for doctors to conduct medical peer reviews using Flex and Cocomo. Cool stuff, but the coolest part is that the free public beta just rolled out.\n</p>\n<p>Kevin announced Adobe Wave, a unified social networking tool. It basically allows you to get email like popups for all of your social networking sites.\n</p>\n<p>Kevin moved on to Devices and Desktops, which meant \"mobile.\"  Evidently Flash will have penetrated 1 Billion phones by 2009.  As always, none of them are here in the US. But a cool announcement was \"Flash 10 for smartphones.\" He showed Flash on Symbian, Flash on Windows Media, and Flash on Android.  He also made it clear that they were working on Flash on the Iphone. I wish we could get Blackberry added to this list.</p>\n<p>They ended with a demo of how they see the phone of the future working.  Pretty interesting.  Lots of interactivity,  able to pass data between phones and other devices.  Very compelling.</p> ','Max 2008 Day 1 Keynote','','publish','open','open','','max-2008-day-1-keynote','','','2008-11-17 11:06:12','2008-11-17 11:06:12','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/max-2008-day-1-keynote',0,'post','',0),(238,1,'2008-11-18 12:01:02','2008-11-18 12:01:02','<p>So, today was the performance art keynote.  Tim Buntel and Ben Forta opened up the keynote through a whole James Bond kinda theme.\n</p>\n<p>Ben showed off what I have to assume is Air manipulating an X10 networking of home devices.\n</p>\n<p>They showed off some cool Flash enhancements.  Basically they added easy animation tools to objects.  Things like skeletons, and easy pathing.  It was available before by dropping down to ActionScript, but now it does it for you.\n</p>\n<p>With Photoshop they showed off that new content aware scaling, where when you rescale an image it scrunches the background without touching foreground images. That and painting on 3d images.\n</p>\n<p>Next up was Flash Catalyst, or Thermo.  It was nice to see a working copy of it.  They took a Photshop image and added behaviors to it in Flash Catalyst. They tweaked the image in Illlustrator.  They added 3d effects to it. It was really impressive.  Basically it seems to me like Flash Catalyst is the first robust application behavior designer.\n</p>\n<p>They then showed off Flash running C code. It\'s a feature called Alchemy.  They started with a Hello World example, then showed off various absurdly cool examples: the OpenSSL library, Raw image transformation,   rendering rasterized PDF within the Flash player. They showed Quake as an Air application, and a Nintendo emulator in Flash 10.\n</p>\n<p>Finally, they moved on Flex Builder with a ColdFusion IDE inside. That\'s right there will be a ColdFusion IDE. It looks like it\'s going to address multiple things that we need: Automatic creation of object services based on Hibernate; CFC introspection, variable awareness.  I can\'t wait to see more this publicly .\n</p>\n<p>I zoned out a bit, but came back to see A network monitor get added to Flex Builder.\n</p>\n<p>Then Ben dropped the bomb that they are working on Flex for Visual Studio developers.\n</p>\n<p>They moved on to Dreamweaver CS4.  It now works with most of the large Ajax frameworks, automatically.\n</p>\n<p>They moved on to show how Flash has teamed up with Google to make searchable Flash content.\n</p>\n<p>The next product demo was the new version of Flash Media Server. FMS can now dynamically change the bit rate without having the distortions that happen when network conditions change. Additionaly, they\'ve made it really to push multi bit rate video into apps your building with Dreamweaver. They\'ve added the ability the add DVR capabilities to live steaming Flash video.  Finally in the Flash player they\'ve added peer to peer video capabilities.\n</p>\n<p>They then handed the show over to Ted Patrick.  He did the official roll out of <a href=\"http://groups.adobe.com\">Adobe Groups</a>.  I think a major plus to this is to make the Adobe Group eco system accessible from people outside the community. Also it will make intra group communications easier.  </p> ','Max 2008 Day 2 Keynote','','publish','open','open','','max-2008-day-2-keynote','','','2008-11-18 12:01:02','2008-11-18 12:01:02','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/max-2008-day-2-keynote',0,'post','',0),(239,1,'2008-11-24 10:55:40','2008-11-24 10:55:40','<p>I\'ve been having a reoccurring problem with one node of our Windows 2008 NLB cluster.

I\'ve added another that\'s not as cool, but still worth mentioning. I think I\'ll try and get it published out to Squidhead users in the next few days.\n</p>\n<p><strong>Feature: Paged and Sortable List views\n</strong></p>\n<p>Basically this feature adds a paging view to the list view, and that view is sortable by each column in the shown in the view. The compelling part of this feature is that it isn\'t doing the sorting and paging in ColdFusion, it writes a stored procedure that can present a sorted query of a particular page size.  Because this happens in the database it\'s blazingly fast.\n</p>\n<p>Writing these types of stored procedures is really annoying. SQL 92 specification prevents variables in the LIMIT, TOP, and ORDER BY clauses.  In order to pull down paged lists of records from the database requires adding an extra temporary column that stores row count and only including particular ranges. Then to do order you have to do a switch case block for every order by possibility.  It\'s the annoying, repetitive code that was designed just so someone could write a code generator to automatically write it.\n</p>\n<p><strong>Feature: List View Filter\n</strong></p>\n<p>The list view filter feature allows you to configure what columns get displayed in the list view of your generated applications.  One of the first things that I do when I go to turn a generated application into a real application is to start manually limiting which columns get shown as inevitably there is a text field that needs to go.  This can now be done by simply altering the table.xml that is generated by Squidhead, and setting the excludefromlistview property to true.\n</p>\n<p><strong>Northwind and Sakila support\n</strong></p>\n<p>This isn\'t really a feature per see, but I\'ve started testing against Northwind for MSSQL and Sakila for MySQL. Both of these are sample databases provided by the vendors. They expose a wide range of database features for each one. By doing testing against them, I found a number of errors and bugs in the Squidhead code that have been rectified. Going forward, Squidhead features will not be released unless they pass these tests.\n</p>\n<p>Like I said earlier, I\'d like to get these features out in the wild in the next few days.\n</p> ','Squidhead&#039;s Latest Features','','publish','open','open','','squidhead-s-latest-features','','','2008-11-24 12:55:33','2008-11-24 12:55:33','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/squidhead-s-latest-features',0,'post','',0),(241,1,'2008-11-25 09:27:17','2008-11-25 09:27:17','<p>For reasons I cannot entirely explain, I was trying to call dynamic methods in a cfc in cfscript.

The folder had an exclamation mark and refused to be committed. I couldn\'t find any reference to what the exclamation mark meant.  SVN cleanup didn\'t work.

I only grabbed only one folder, the folder containing the error handling templates; I just copied the folder via Eclipse from the original version controlled project to my new one.

As time has gone on I\'ve become to rely on it heavily. Nothing illustrates that quite as much as the feeling you get when it isn\'t accessible anymore.\n</p>\n<p>You see my business office changed their credit card info.  They gave me access to their new card and a typed its numbers into Unfuddle.com\'s automatic biller. When I did that, I must have transposed a few numbers.  Yesterday was the day that automatic billing takes place.  We were charged, the charge failed, and as such due to a bug in their system our quota was lowered to its free level (200MB) instead of our actual quota (10GB.) Once you go over quota, they lock down your account to prevent subsequent commits and updates.  I\'m sure they do this to prevent runaway processes from going over quota and causing problems.  It also has the effect of bringing everything to a grinding halt.\n</p>\n<p>I fixed the credit card, and got confirmation from the system that I had entered it correctly this time.  But still no commits.\n</p>\n<p>I sent in a support email, as that is their only means of support contact. But my boss started circling asking when he would be able to commit again.  He started talking faster, and faster, which made it clear that he was getting agitated by the possibility of problems publishing his application for an important demo this morning.\n</p>\n<p>So I started searching through previous correspondence with support to see if they had a phone number in their signature.  Lo and behold, one support technician had his mobile phone in his signature.  At this point I\'m torn: I don\'t want to bother this guy on his mobile; but I didn\'t want my boss to become <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0608321/\">John Moschitta</a>.  Finally after looking up the area code and finding out the guy was in Hawaii, I decided that if he got to be a cool web 2.0 programmer and live in Hawaii then I was going to not feel too bad about calling him on his mobile.\n</p>\n<p>He was extremely cool about being bothered (he was in fact not in the office that day). But I explained the situation, and told I would accept being shunted to another support person (as he was out of the office,) but he would have none of it and within literally 3 minutes of talking to him, we were happily unfuddling again.  He also said he would look into the bug that caused us to not have the customary 2 week compliance period.\n</p>\n<p>I\'m already a pretty pleased customer but this turned me into a passionate customer.

Second, I like the idea of CodeCop, but I\'ve never been good enough at writing regular expressions to craft my own rules well enough to use it. Those points being said, as great as these tools are, they do not even come close to eliminating the need for formal code reviews.\n</p>\n<p>Automatic testers are great at finding small discreet known issues:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Did you var scope every variable in ever function?\n</li>\n<li>Did you make sure not to use relative url\'s in cfschedule?\n</li>\n<li>Did you use cfqueryparam on all of your user input driven queries?\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But they can\'t figure out bigger picture issues like:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is this function named \"computeCosine\" actually returning the sine?\n</li>\n<li>Is there <strong>sufficient</strong> validation occurring on form posts before they are being processed?\n</li>\n<li>Is this function doing something that a built in function could be doing better?\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to the hard to compute issues above, there are the unknowns. Until someone discovered there was an issue with using relative url\'s in cfschedule there was no rule written in the code review tool. It takes human eyes to discover these issues, either during a review, or during bug fixing.  Only after they are discovered can they be codified.\n</p>\n<p>To put more succinctly and in a metaphorical manner:\n</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Automatic code review tools are spell checkers. Formal code reviewers are editors. Spell checkers and even grammar checkers don\'t prevent you from writing perfectly spelled and constructed crap. You need an editor to prevent that. Just as code review tools don\'t prevent you from writing crap code that adheres to all of their rules.\n</p>\n<p>So use automatic tools before a formal code review, just like you spell check an email before you send it out.

I\'m confident it will be. ORM and the IDE will be the most talked about features. Although ORM is talked about, it will be slow to move in to the mainstream of CF development. Considering the time it took to get CFC\'s to be widely adopted, I think ORM will be what\'s hot in 2010 but bleeding edge in 2009. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">The IDE will be a big seller, and I mean seller. I think the IDE will be a for purchase and stand-alone product. I think there will be a lot of people developing on Bolt and Centaur for production ColdFusion 8 applications for some time to come.</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\"><strong>ColdFusion Development</strong><br />Apple will continue to gain market share among CF developers. Ubuntu boxes will also proliferate as Vista users with regrets can\'t justify new hardware purchases but tire of Vista\'s drawbacks.</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\"><strong>Web Development in General</strong><br />Rails and Merb joining together will cause the Ruby development community to get a major boost. The meme that \"rails is cool, but not ready for enterprise\" will really get challenged. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\"><strong>Technology in General</strong><br />There will be an increase in problems due to companies putting off equipment upgrades in an attempt to cut costs. I think companies will continue to push more hardware outsourcing regardless if they experience a cost-cutting driven failure or not.</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">That\'s all I have for now, if I think of more I\'ll add...</p>\n<p><br class=\"final-break\" style=\"clear: both\" /></p> ','2009 Predictions','','publish','open','open','','2009-predictions','','','2008-12-30 19:39:48','2008-12-30 19:39:48','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/2009-predictions',0,'post','',5),(246,1,'2009-01-01 08:08:00','2009-01-01 08:08:00','<p style=\"clear: both\">Spurred on by <a href=\"http://blog.kevinhoyt.org/\">Kevin Hoyt</a>, who commented on my <a href=\"/blog/post.cfm/2009-predictions\">last post</a> I have some predictions for technology in higher education as a whole. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">First, a quick background. The economy sucks. This is good news and bad news for higher ed. Enrollment and applications will be up. Bad news, is that most institutions arenapost entirely funded by tuition. Money comes into schools from state governements and the federal government in addition to money from their endowments and donations. All of those sources will be down in the next two years at least. Also in the picture is that fact that because of institutional culture of tenure, and the compliance issues that come from taking federal money, most higher ed institutions cannot cut budgets by trimming employees from the books. Good news, you\'ve still got your job, bad news, remember Ed who quit, you\'ve got his too. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">Cost savings will be sought elsewhere. This is going to lead to a contraction of commitments. Upgrades will be postponed. Technology investments (big virtual machine hosting hardware, SAN\'s) will not be pursued. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">So what will all this lead to...<br /><br /><strong>Hosting</strong><br />Up until now, a penchant for open source technology, and educational discounts have made schools prefer to host their own services a little longer than the rest of technological community. However, that was before the financial craptaculon. External hosting will be considered for applications which would never have been outsourced before. It\'s already started for student email, IM, web sites, and storage. It will accelerate and be targeted for smaller burdens like staff email, intranet sites, and public websites.</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\"><strong>Virtual Classrooms</strong><br />Virtual classrooms where schools could sell an unlimited number of seats to an audience for a set cost has been a holy grail for a few years now. With cut travel budgets hitting continuing education dollars, and the rise in applications coupled with the pressure to bring in revenue, they will have no choice to squeeze every dollar they can. Expect a lot of activity here.</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\"><strong>Development Language free for all</strong><br />Because of the rise of hosting for previously unhosted solutions, there will be no lock in for particular platforms or languages. Want to try Ruby or make the switch to .NET? No worries, you don\'t have to build an environment, just rent it. It provides opportunities for highly productive languages and solutions to re-argue their case to the higher education world.</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\"><strong>Students</strong><br />Students are going to be looking to either stay out of the job market for as long as possible, or get trained in skills that will more likely get them hired. Any schools out there have Flex or Ajax content in their program, congrats, your students are still marketable. Expect more focus on vocational skills, like specific languages to be the rage.</p>\n<p><br class=\"final-break\" style=\"clear: both\" /></p> ','2009 Predictions in Higher Ed','','publish','open','open','','2009-predictions-in-higher-ed','','','2009-01-01 08:08:00','2009-01-01 08:08:00','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/2009-predictions-in-higher-ed',0,'post','',1),(247,1,'2009-01-08 08:28:00','2009-01-08 08:28:00','<p>I\'m working with the <a href=\"http://www.constantcontact.com/index.jsp\">ConstantContact</a> API webservice, and ran into a slight problem.  The API uses Digest Authentication, and ColdFusion does not support Digest Authentication in cfhttp.  I found this out by reading in the <a href=\"http://livedocs.adobe.com/coldfusion/8/htmldocs/help.html?content=Tags_g-h_09.html\">live docs</a> that:\n</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 36pt\"><em>The cfhttp tag does not support NTLM or Digest Authentication.\n</em></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://developer.constantcontact.com/node/103\">ConstantContact forums</a> pointed me to a custom tag <a href=\"http://www.cftagstore.com/tags/cfxhttp5.cfm\">cfx_http5</a>.  But I hate CFX tags.  I like to place as few dependencies on the ColdFusion Administrator as possible when I code.  CFX tags also tend not to make the trip the first time in server migrations or emergency moves.  It might be my own prejudice but, no, there will be no custom tags.\n</p>\n<p>Which leaves me to implementing some Java client, as luck would have it there was ample documentation on doing this. I just needed to use the open source <a href=\"http://hc.apache.org/httpclient-3.x/\">Apache HTTP client</a>.  To work with them, I had to add them to the class path, or add an entry in the ColdFusion Administrator class path list.  That would have bought me nothing, as I didn\'t want to go through the administrator.\n</p>\n<p>This left me looking for a way to dynamically call jar files. If only there was some way to dynamically call jar files in ColdFusion... preferably written by someone with a marsupial pouch.... Ohh wait, <a href=\"http://www.compoundtheory.com/\">Mark Mandel</a> wrote the Open Source project <a href=\"http://javaloader.riaforge.org/\">JavaLoader</a>, which allows just that. Hmm, and Mark is a mammal from Australia. Things are looking good.\n</p>\n<p>So I was able to build my http client with Digest Authentication.  I added some code that formatted the response like a cfhttp struct, so that if there were other advantages to this method I could just swap out this for cfhttp in a pinch.

I have been working at <a href=\"http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/\">Wharton</a> since June of 1999.  10 years.  10 yeaaaaars.  10 years.\n</p><p>I started as an entry level desktop support person for some faculty and the student course pack print shop.  I moved on to become a system administrator.  <a href=\"http://guamaniac.wordpress.com/\">Joe Cruz</a> introduced me to <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion/\">ColdFusion</a>. I helped setup classroom technology for two new Wharton facilities: <a href=\"http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/campus/wharton_west/\">Wharton West</a> and <a href=\"http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/huntsmanhall/tour/\">Huntsman Hall</a>. I took over the ColdFusion Administrators group.  I moved on to <a href=\"http://wrds.wharton.upenn.edu/\">WRDS</a>, and ended at <a href=\"http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/\">Knowledge@Wharton</a>.\n</p><p>I\'ve worked for almost every directorship in Wharton Computing.  I witnessed 2 major technological catastrophes: the Exchange Disaster of 2001 and the Mother\'s Day Craptaculon of 2005.\n</p><p>Wharton has provided me with the opportunity to meet and form relationships with about a dozen major vendors including <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/\">Adobe</a>, <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com\">Microsoft</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.dell.com/\">Dell</a>. It\'s allowed me access to the wider technology community in Philadelphia. It\'s allowed me the opportunity to work as co-workers with some of the smartest people in the technology community.  Finally, it\'s given me the opportunity to participate in the ColdFusion community which has given me a group of friends and colleges which straddles the entire globe.\n</p><p>As my year count at Wharton grew, I was often asked why I hadn\'t moved on with my career. I think it\'s obvious.  I moved on with my career about 3 or 4 times, it just so happened that I stayed with the same employer.  There\'s always more to do, there\'s always some place to go here at Wharton.\n</p><p>Add to the brilliant co-workers, and the career opportunities - an incredible benefits package, freedom to experiment and flexibility to live, and Wharton\'s pretty hard to beat.\n</p><p>On a personal level, I met my wife here. We carried on a relationship for quite a few years before everyone knew we were together. I proposed during the aforementioned Mother\'s Day Craptaculon. (At home though, not at work, that would be a bit too much.) We were married with co-workers amongst the crowd. We had the same boss at the time. My son was born while I was here, and was born in a hospital that was part of the same University system as Wharton.\n</p><p>This leads me to the <a href=\"http://www.upenn.edu/\">University of Pennsylvania</a>, where I have spent nearly every day (summers included) since 1995. If Wharton shaped who I am professionally, Penn shaped who I am personally.  Penn convinced me that Clinical Psychology was no career for me. Penn has pretty much given me every one of my closest friends. (Except for a handful left over from high school.)\n</p><p>I was 18. That was 14 years ago. 14 years before that I was 4. It\'s not hyperbole to suggest that this signals the next major section of my life.\n</p><p>So wow, I didn\'t mean to get so sappy, but I guess I really do like this place.  If you have the opportunity to work here, take it.  I won\'t claim it\'s perfect, it\'s not, and no place ever is.  However, in this world and time of settling for a paycheck, it\'s nice to have the opportunity to work for a place that encourages you to be part of something and to work to keep you with them while letting you take your career unfold the way you want.\n</p><p>I\'m not quite ready to talk about what\'s next, except to say that I\'ve got something lined up.

I think that this occurs because people often overlook one of ColdFusion most accepted benefits. <strong>ColdFusion is exceedingly easy to learn.</strong>  Which leads me to my biggest piece of ColdFusion hiring advice – don\'t look for good ColdFusion developers, look for good web developers, if they know ColdFusion, great, if not, teach them, or let them learn it.\n</p><p>The argument I hear back on this point is \"we don\'t have the time of resources to train someone; we need them to hit the ground running.\"  I think this is penny wise pound foolish.  Based on anecdotal evidence only, I would contend that it takes an average web programmer about 1 or 2 months to learn ColdFusion. (This assumes they know HTML, CSS, SQL and another server side language.)  I\'ve seen some ColdFusion job hunts take upwards of 9 months.  You can\'t afford the month to train an employee, but you can be without them for 9 months? That doesn\'t make a lot of sense to me.\n</p><p>Add to it that for the cost of 1 or 2 months, you get a ColdFusion developer who knows another language.  Developers who know more languages tend to be better.  ColdFusion programmers that know Ruby for example are usually better Object Oriented ColdFusion developers through the knowledge they picked up in Ruby.\n</p><p>Now, I\'m not arguing that you shouldn\'t hire a ColdFusion developer if you can find one. I happen to know a few that are looking for work.  I also don\'t mean to suggest that finding a good web developer is necessarily that much easier than finding a good ColdFusion developer.  Finding \"good\" people is never easy, but  I am arguing that you need to increase your chances of finding someone to fill your position. You can do this by opening up your search criteria, and letting one of the major selling points of ColdFusion actually work for you.\n</p><p>What do you think, does this agree with what you\'ve seen in the job market of late?\n</p> ','Stop Looking for ColdFusion Developers','','publish','open','open','','stop-looking-for-coldfusion-developers','','','2009-01-27 11:27:00','2009-01-27 11:27:00','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/stop-looking-for-coldfusion-developers',0,'post','',16),(252,1,'2009-01-28 11:57:00','2009-01-28 11:57:00','<p>I will be speaking about <a href=\"http://squidhead.riaforge.org/\">Squidhead</a> to the <a href=\"http://www.ncfug.com/go/meeting/meetingID/200C8C56-DE37-00C1-7EB4D954E049731E/\">Nashville CFUG Thursday January 29th, 2009</a>.

Last week I was an Adobe community member, now I am an employee. Last week I thought I knew hidden unspoken motivations behind Adobe\'s actions, now I know I didn\'t even come close to guessing them.  Last week Ben Forta was that guy on the stage giving keynotes, now he\'s my boss\' boss.\n</p><p>Mind you, I\'m not complaining, it\'s as awesome a gig as I\'ve imagined, but it\'s still a shock to the system.

This has been my chief reason for loving ColdFusion from day one. I\'m going to take a few tasks, and show you how easy ColdFusion makes them.\n</p><p>Get some data out of a database and display it on a page:\n</p>\n<code><cfquery name=\"results\" datasource=\"cfartgallery\">\n	SELECT 	firstName, lastname\n	FROM 	app.artists\n</cfquery>\n\n<cfoutput query=\"results\">\n#FirstName# #lastName#<br />\n</cfoutput>\n</code>\n\n<p>Querying from a database using CFQuery just feels natural and easy.  I personally hate saving SQL to a string, then attaching it to query object that I then execute. Looping over the results of query is also simple and straightforward. I don\'t have to worry about addressing the query in a collection or other structure, CFoutput handles looping over the results and pointing my call of \"firstname\" to the firstname column in the current row of the results.\n</p><p>Send a short email to someone:\n</p>\n<code><cfmail to=\"terry@terrrenceryan.com\" from=\"terry@terrenceryan.com\" subject=\"A test mail\">\n	This is a test message\n</cfmail>\n</code>\n<p>Similar to the database query, sending mail from ColdFusion is just drop dead simple. More than that, it\'s pretty intuitive.  It\'s hard to not understand what is going on here.\n</p><p>These are pretty standard, and most tools have patterns written for them to make this sort of basic functionality easy to write. So let\'s take on some harder tasks.\n</p><p>Create a PDF from some content:\n</p>\n<code><cfdocument format=\"PDF\">\n	<p>Hello World</p>\n</cfdocument>\n</code>\n<p>I contend that printing a document to the PDF Print driver takes more effort than doing it in ColdFusion.  Feel free to disagree.\n</p><p>Create an image for use in CAPTCHA testing:\n</p>\n<code><cfimage action=\"captcha\" text=\"rEadMe\">\n</code>\n<p>Notwithstanding everyone\'s hatred for CAPTCHA, that\'s shockingly easy to create a CAPTCHA image.\n</p><p>Okay, again nothing we did was too crazy but you have to admit that is some really easy, concise, easy to comprehend code. Let\'s do something a little harder.\n</p>\n<p>Pull all appointments named \"Lunch\" from your Exchange Server:\n</p>\n<code><cfexchangeconnection action=\"open\" connection=\"exConn\"\n		server=\"#mailhost#\" mailboxName=\"#mailbox#\"\n		username = \"#username#\" password = \"#password#\" />\n\n<cfexchangecalendar action = \"get\" name = \"calendar1\" connection = \"exConn\">\n	<cfexchangefilter name=\"subject\" value=\"Lunch\" />\n</cfexchangecalendar>\n</code>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.terrenceryan.com/blog/index.cfm/2007/4/25/adobe_made_me_obsolete\">I\'ve said it before</a>, the only way of working with Exchange that is easier than ColdFusion is Outlook.\n</p><p>Pass a result generated from .Net to a Java string for use by a custom Java Library:\n</p>\n<code><cfset pwd = CreateObject(\".Net\", \"System.IO.Directory\").getCurrentDirectory() />\n<cfset jString = CreateObject(\"java\", \"java.lang.String\").init(pwd) />\n</code>\n\n\n<p>Interoperability between .Net and Java, in two lines of code? That\'s kinda ridiculous.\n</p><p>Now, to be clear here, I\'m not saying you can\'t do all of this in other languages, I\'m saying this is the easiest I\'ve ever seen it done.  The team behind ColdFusion has done a great job of balancing between encapsulating the difficult, but making it easy to go beyond what they enabled.  All of the tags used in the examples have many more attributes that you can use to fine to the behavior show off here.\n</p><p>This was a overview of how easy ColdFusion makes it to do hard things, in the next series post I will talk more about what you can do with ColdFusion when ColdFusion can\'t do what you want it to do.

He reminded me of a feature of ColdFusion that gets overlooked because it is so elemental to the language: the query variable.\n</p><p>In ColdFusion results that are returned from database get returned in a query variable.  Query variables are an implementation of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterator_pattern\">iterator pattern</a> and have a few special properties:\n</p><ul><li>Queries map columns from the database into easily addressable properties\n</li><li>Queries also have the obvious properties named recordCount, currentRow, and columnList\n</li><li>Queries have hooks to that cfloop and cfoutput can iterate over them\n</li><li>Properties of queries can be addressed easily within an iterating process\n</li></ul><p>That\'s all a really complicated way of describing what happens in this code:\n</p>\n\n<code><cfquery name=\"qry\" datasource=\"cfartgallery\">\n	SELECT 	firstName, lastname\n	FROM 	app.artists\n</cfquery>\n\n<cfoutput>\n	<p>#qry.recordCount# records returned with columns named: #qry.columnList#</p>\n</cfoutput>\n\n<cfoutput query=\"qry\">\n#currentRow# of #recordcount# -  #FirstName# #lastName#<br />\n</cfoutput></code>\n\n\n<p>You see, the first cfoutput tag didn\'t have a query attribute, so I had to prepend the properties <em>recordCount</em> and <em>columnList</em> with <em>qry. </em>Later when I was iterating over the query using cfoutput, I didn\'t have to bother prepending.\n</p><p>That\'s cool, and easy, but not outside the realm of what you can do in other languages. So let\'s get to what Kevin mentioned in his comment <em>Query of Queries</em>. Query of Queries refers to ColdFusion\'s ability to use a ColdFusion query as a table against which to perform SQL in another query. Want to get all of the records from the previous query that begins with A:\n</p>\n<code><cfquery name=\"anames\" dbtype=\"query\">\n	SELECT 	firstName, lastname\n	FROM 	qry\n	WHERE 	firstname like \'A%\'\n</cfquery>\n</code>\n\n<p>Want to get all of the records that begin with E:\n</p>\n<code><cfquery name=\"enames\" dbtype=\"query\">\n	SELECT 	firstName, lastname\n	FROM 	qry\n	WHERE 	firstname like \'E%\'\n</cfquery>\n</code>\n\n<p>Want to combine the A records and E records: </p>\n<code><cfquery name=\"uber\" dbtype=\"query\">\n	SELECT 	firstName, lastname\n	FROM 	anames\n	UNION\n	SELECT 	firstName, lastname\n	FROM 	enames\n</cfquery>\n</code>\n\n<p>That\'s right query of queries will let you do unions or joins too.\n</p><p>Now some of you might be questioning the usefulness of this.  You think things like filtering, joins and unions are operations best handled by the database. You\'re right they do. But, imagine that I was pulling data out of separate databases, perhaps one in Oracle, and one in MSSQL? You couldn\'t do it in the database.\n</p><p>Also cfquery is not the only tag in ColdFusion that creates query variables. The others include (But I\'m sure I\'m missing some):\n</p><ul><li>cfdbinfo\n</li><li>cfdirectory\n</li><li>cffeed\n</li><li>cfexchange tags\n</li><li>cfldap\n</li><li>cfsearch\n</li><li>cfstoredproc\n</li></ul><p>That means you can take any of the results of these tags and filter and group and join them just the way you can with a database.  Want to see all of the files in your directory and are not .cfm files:\n</p>\n<code><cfdirectory action=\"list\" name=\"files\" directory=\"#ExpandPath(\'.\')#\" />\n<cfquery name=\"nonCFFiles\" dbtype=\"query\">\n	SELECT 	*, directory + \'/\' + name as fullpath\n	FROM 	files\n	WHERE 	name not like \'%.cfm\'\n</cfquery>\n\n<table>\n<cfoutput query=\"nonCFFiles\">\n<tr>\n	<td>#fullpath#</td>\n	<td>#size#</td>\n	<td>#datelastmodified#</td>\n</tr>\n</cfoutput>\n</table>\n</code>\n\n<p>That\'s pretty easy, and I think that qualifies as something not every solution can do. It opens up the door to a lot of other possibilities:\n</p><ul><li>Joining LDAP data to SQL Data\n</li><li>Creating a union of multiple RSS feeds\n</li><li>Joining data about stored files to SQL data\n</li><li>Joining RSS feed data to Exchange users\n</li></ul><p>ColdFusion queries, and query of queries are powerful features that make one of the most common jobs in web programming – displaying some kind of retrieved record – shockingly simple. Add to it that the number of entities addressable in a ColdFusion query includes many other sources than just the database, and you have one powerful feature that is not easily matched.  </p> ','Queries are the Secret Sauce of ColdFusion','','publish','open','open','','queries-are-the-secret-sauce-of-coldfusion','','','2009-02-11 09:02:00','2009-02-11 09:02:00','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/queries-are-the-secret-sauce-of-coldfusion',0,'post','',8),(262,1,'2009-02-11 14:26:00','2009-02-11 14:26:00','<p>I got to see a very cool use for Flex and AIR in Higher Education today.

He told me that they spent most of their time upfront researching how exactly dentist\'s offices would need to interact with a system.  That yielded a few custom interfaces, including the \"radiograph view\" which the rest of us just know as \"an x-ray of all of your teeth.\" The other cool thing I noticed was the high emphasis they place on important information like \"Severe Penicillin Allergy.\" Clearly, this program really does focus on quality computer-human interactions.\n</p><p>The project itself is a prototype; don\'t expect to see it in your dentist\'s office anytime soon.

ColdFusion ships with drivers for talking seamlessly to the following database systems:\n</p><ul><li>Apache Derby    \n</li><li>MS Access    \n</li><li>MS SQL Server    \n</li><li>MySQL     \n</li><li>PostgreSQL      \n</li><li>DB2\n</li><li>Informix Dynamic Server    \n</li><li>Oracle\n</li><li>Sybase\n</li></ul><p>Does that mean if you are a FoxPro or SQLite developer, you\'re out of luck?  Hardly - if it has a JDBC driver you can talk to it with ColdFusion.\n</p><p>Databases are only a portion of what you have to deal with, especially if you are talking to back end systems with various interfaces.  The can include directory servers, file servers, mail servers, etc.  Here\'s a non exhaustive list of ColdFusion tags that can talk to those sorts of servers:\n</p><div><table style=\"border-collapse:collapse\" border=\"0\"><colgroup><col style=\"width:298px\"/><col style=\"width:292px\"/></colgroup><tbody valign=\"top\"><tr><td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px; border-top:  solid black 0.5pt; border-left:  solid black 0.5pt; border-bottom:  solid black 0.5pt; border-right:  solid black 0.5pt\"><p>cffile, cfdirectory </p></td><td style=\"padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px; border-top:  solid black 0.5pt; border-left:  none; border-bottom:  solid black 0.5pt; border-right:  solid black 0.5pt\"><p>Both local and remote file stores </p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px; border-top:  none; border-left:  solid black 0.5pt; border-bottom:  solid black 0.5pt; border-right:  solid black 0.5pt\"><p>cfexchangecalendar, cfexchangemail, cfexchangeconnection, cfexchangetask, cfexchangecontact, cfexchangefilter</p></td><td style=\"padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px; border-top:  none; border-left:  none; border-bottom:  solid black 0.5pt; border-right:  solid black 0.5pt\"><p>Microsoft Exchange Servers </p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px; border-top:  none; border-left:  solid black 0.5pt; border-bottom:  solid black 0.5pt; border-right:  solid black 0.5pt\"><p>cfftp  </p></td><td style=\"padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px; border-top:  none; border-left:  none; border-bottom:  solid black 0.5pt; border-right:  solid black 0.5pt\"><p>FTP and SFTP servers </p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px; border-top:  none; border-left:  solid black 0.5pt; border-bottom:  solid black 0.5pt; border-right:  solid black 0.5pt\"><p>cfhttp </p></td><td style=\"padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px; border-top:  none; border-left:  none; border-bottom:  solid black 0.5pt; border-right:  solid black 0.5pt\"><p>Other web servers, REST webservices </p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px; border-top:  none; border-left:  solid black 0.5pt; border-bottom:  solid black 0.5pt; border-right:  solid black 0.5pt\"><p>cfldap  </p></td><td style=\"padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px; border-top:  none; border-left:  none; border-bottom:  solid black 0.5pt; border-right:  solid black 0.5pt\"><p>LDAP Directory services, Active Directory </p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px; border-top:  none; border-left:  solid black 0.5pt; border-bottom:  solid black 0.5pt; border-right:  solid black 0.5pt\"><p>cfmail, cfmailpart, cfmailparam </p></td><td style=\"padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px; border-top:  none; border-left:  none; border-bottom:  solid black 0.5pt; border-right:  solid black 0.5pt\"><p>SMTP servers for sending mail</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px; border-top:  none; border-left:  solid black 0.5pt; border-bottom:  solid black 0.5pt; border-right:  solid black 0.5pt\"><p>cfobject, cfinvoke </p></td><td style=\"padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px; border-top:  none; border-left:  none; border-bottom:  solid black 0.5pt; border-right:  solid black 0.5pt\"><p>SOAP webservices </p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px; border-top:  none; border-left:  solid black 0.5pt; border-bottom:  solid black 0.5pt; border-right:  solid black 0.5pt\"><p>cfntauthenticate </p></td><td style=\"padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px; border-top:  none; border-left:  none; border-bottom:  solid black 0.5pt; border-right:  solid black 0.5pt\"><p>Active Directory for authentication purposes </p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px; border-top:  none; border-left:  solid black 0.5pt; border-bottom:  solid black 0.5pt; border-right:  solid black 0.5pt\"><p>cfpop </p></td><td style=\"padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px; border-top:  none; border-left:  none; border-bottom:  solid black 0.5pt; border-right:  solid black 0.5pt\"><p>POP3 Mail servers for acting as a mail client </p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px; border-top:  none; border-left:  solid black 0.5pt; border-bottom:  solid black 0.5pt; border-right:  solid black 0.5pt\"><p>cfprint </p></td><td style=\"padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px; border-top:  none; border-left:  none; border-bottom:  solid black 0.5pt; border-right:  solid black 0.5pt\"><p>Any printer accessible by the ColdFusion host </p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>\n </p><p>That\'s a pretty big list.  Keep in mind that it\'s not just about talking to those services; it\'s about easily talking to those services. Yesterday, I showed the cfexchange tags and cfmail tags in action.  They\'re all pretty much that easy and concise to use.\n</p><p>Next, ColdFusion can call just about anything that can be run from the command line via cfexcecute:\n</p>\n<code><cfset pathToScript = ExpandPath(\'.\') & \"/rubytest.rb\" />\n<cfexecute name=\"ruby\" arguments=\"#pathToScript#\" variable=\"results\" timeout=\"1\" />\n<cfoutput>#results#</cfoutput></code>\n\n<p>That\'s not necessarily compelling.  Pretty much every programming tool can make calls to the shell.  But I think it\'s important to point it out, keeping in mind that this is a must have feature for any tool.\n</p><p>But shelling out to the OS, running a command, reading it into a variable and parsing it is a pain.  It\'s a lot of extra coding, extra bug trapping, and usually a performance hit. So it would be nice if you could interface with certain other tools without having to do that.\n</p><p>I kinda, gave a sneak preview of some of this content the other day, when I showed getting information from .Net into Java in two lines of code:\n</p>\n<code><cfset pwd = CreateObject(\".Net\", \"System.IO.Directory\").getCurrentDirectory() />\n<cfset jString = CreateObject(\"java\", \"java.lang.String\").init(pwd) />\n</code>\n<p>I didn\'t have to import any libraries to accomplish this, it just worked from the moment I installed ColdFusion. I consumed a .Net assembly, got a string from it, and passed it a Java Object. That was just a string, but if the return had been a more complex object, ColdFusion would have converted it to a native ColdFusion structure.  Any errors would have been caught and delivered via ColdFusion\'s error handling mechanism.  The same applies to the Java call.\n</p><p>The .Net communication was added in ColdFusion 8, but the Java communication has been around since ColdFusion MX 6.  The reason behind this is the often overlooked fact that ColdFusion is written in Java, runs on Java, and can be looked at as Java framework.  Anything Java can do, you can get done in a ColdFusion page or component. You might have to drop down to coding in Java to do it, but that\'s pretty easy to do:\n</p>\n<code><cfset math = CreateObject(\"java\", \"java.lang.Math\") />\n<cfset result = math.pow(2,5) />\n<cfoutput>#result#</cfoutput>\n</code>\n\n<p>As you can see, I can use the result generated by Java without any special conversion.\n</p><p>Finally, ColdFusion can run with support from Adobe on many platforms:\n</p><ul><li><div>Windows\n</div><ul><li>Windows XP\n</li><li>Windows Vista\n</li><li>Windows 2000\n</li><li>Windows 2003\n</li><li>Windows 2008\n</li></ul></li><li><div>Mac\n</div><ul><li>OS X 10.4, 10.5\n</li></ul></li><li><div>Linux\n</div><ul><li>Red Hat 3.0, 4.0, 5.0\n</li><li>SUSE 9, 10\n</li></ul></li><li><div>Solaris\n</div><ul><li>Solaris 9, 10\n</li></ul></li><li><div>AIX\n</div><ul><li>AIX 5L, 5.2, 5.3\n</li></ul></li></ul><p>Those are just the <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion/systemreqs/\">supported platforms</a>.  It\'s also quite possible to run CF on Ubuntu or Centos.  (But I must stress, Adobe doesn\'t support these distros of Linux, yet.)\n</p><p>I hope, I was able to show you in this long, but frankly shallow overview, that ColdFusion can talk to a lot of different system, using many different interfaces, and do so on pretty much every mainstream platform you could need.</p> ','ColdFusion Plays Well With Others','','publish','open','open','','coldfusion-plays-well-with-others','','','2009-02-12 09:27:00','2009-02-12 09:27:00','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/coldfusion-plays-well-with-others',0,'post','',5),(264,1,'2009-02-12 12:14:00','2009-02-12 12:14:00','<p><a href=\"http://www.buntel.com/blog/\">Tim Buntel</a> just posted <a href=\"http://www.buntel.com/blog/index.cfm/2009/2/12/CF-and-the-future-of-Flex\">a call for ColdFusion Developers to join the pre-release program for Flex Builder 4</a>.

ColdFusion doesn\'t force you to use only it for all layers of your web application.  You can selectively choose to use ColdFusion for as much or as little of your application as you want.  ColdFusion doesn\'t just <em>allow</em> this, like everything else, it <em>makes it easy</em>. Off the top of my head here are some uses cases for ColdFusion in your application:\n</p><ul><li>Traditional HTML generated application by ColdFusion\n</li><li>Complete client layer using built in ColdFusion AJAX components\n</li><li>Back end to AJAX driven front end using cfajaxproxy\n</li><li>Back end to Flex application using Flash Remoting or LiveCycle Data Services ES\n</li><li>Bridge between your application and messaging services (JMS, SMS, XMPP) with Event Gateways\n</li></ul><p>Let\'s start with the traditional HTML generated application:\n</p>\n\n<code><cfquery name=\"qry\" datasource=\"cfartgallery\">\n	SELECT 	*\n	FROM 	app.artists\n</cfquery>\n\n<table>\n	<tr><th>Name</th><th>City</th><th>State</th></tr>\n	<cfoutput query=\"qry\">\n		<tr><td>#firstName# #lastName#</td><td>#city#</td><td>#State#</td></tr>\n	</cfoutput>\n</table>\n</code>\n\n\n<p>Sure, I can just take a query and pass it to an HTML renderer and... instant data screen. ColdFusion can do the entire thing.  But that code would provide a poor user experience.  That table is pretty much just phoning it in.  Instead, I can use ColdFusion\'s built in AJAX features to make a better UI using a datagrid.\n</p><p>First I have to move the query to a CFC, and run it through a simple function that formats the data for the datagrid:\n</p>\n<code><cfcomponent output=\"false\">\n\n	<cffunction name=\"list\" access=\"remote\"  returntype=\"query\">\n		<cfset var qry = \"\" />\n\n		<cfquery name=\"qry\" datasource=\"cfartgallery\">\n			SELECT 	*\n			FROM 	app.artists\n		</cfquery>\n\n		<cfreturn qry />\n	</cffunction>\n\n	<cffunction name=\"listForGrid\" access=\"remote\"  returntype=\"struct\" returnformat=\"json\">\n		<cfargument name=\"page\" type=\"numeric\" required=\"true\">\n		<cfargument name=\"pagesize\" type=\"numeric\" required=\"true\">\n		<cfargument name=\"sortcol\" type=\"string\" required=\"false\">\n		<cfargument name=\"sortdir\" type=\"string\" required=\"false\">\n\n		<cfreturn queryConvertForGrid(list(), arguments.page, arguments.pagesize) />\n	</cffunction>\n\n</cfcomponent>\n</code>\n\n<p>Once that is done, I can call that CFC from a datagrid component:\n</p>\n<code><cfform name=\"tableform\">\n    <cfgrid format=\"html\" name=\"grid\"\n	bind=\"cfc:data.listForGrid({cfgridpage},{cfgridpagesize},{cfgridsortcolumn},{cfgridsortdirection})\">\n        <cfgridcolumn name=\"firstName\" header=\"First Name\" >\n        <cfgridcolumn name=\"lastName\" header=\"Last Name\" >\n        <cfgridcolumn name=\"city\" header=\"City\" >\n        <cfgridcolumn name=\"state\" header=\"State\" >\n    </cfgrid>\n</cfform>\n</code>\n\n\n<p>Or I can instead opt out of using ColdFusion UI components, and either roll my own or use an established framework (both using cfajaxproxy):\n</p>\n<code><cfajaxproxy cfc=\"data\" jsclassname=\"cfData\" />\n\n<s cript type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"qtt.js\" />\n\n<div id=\"dataTable\" />\n\n<s cript type=\"text/javascript\">\n\n	var cfData = new cfData();\n	cfData.setSyncMode();\n	cfData.setQueryFormat(\'column\');\n\n	datatable = document.getElementById(\'dataTable\');\n	res = cfData.list();\n	table = queryToTable(res);\n\n	datatable.appendChild(table);\n\n	function queryToTable(result){\n\n		table = document.createElement(\'table\');\n		tbody = document.createElement(\'tbody\');\n\n		for(i=0;i<res.ROWCOUNT;i++){\n	        row = document.createElement(\'tr\');\n\n			cellFname = document.createElement(\'td\');\n			txtFname = document.createTextNode(res.DATA.FIRSTNAME[i]);\n			cellFname.appendChild(txtFname);\n			row.appendChild(cellFname);\n\n			cellLName = document.createElement(\'td\');\n			txtLName = document.createTextNode(res.DATA.LASTNAME[i]);\n			cellLName.appendChild(txtLName);\n			row.appendChild(cellLName);\n\n			cellCity = document.createElement(\'td\');\n			txtCity = document.createTextNode(res.DATA.CITY[i]);\n			cellCity.appendChild(txtCity);\n			row.appendChild(cellCity);\n\n			cellState = document.createElement(\'td\');\n			txtState = document.createTextNode(res.DATA.STATE[i]);\n			cellState.appendChild(txtState);\n			row.appendChild(cellState);\n\n			tbody.appendChild(row);\n\n	   }\n\n		table.appendChild(tbody);\n		return table;\n	}\n\n</script>\n</code>\n\n\n<p>If, however, I wanted to go with something other than HTML/JavaScript for the front end, I still have options. ColdFusion is perfectly suited to act as a back end for Flex. In fact that CFC above still works with Flex. To call it from Flex I just have to point an end point to it and add a datagrid:\n</p>\n<code><?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<mx:Application xmlns:mx=\"http://www.adobe.com/2006/mxml\" layout=\"absolute\" applicationComplete=\"getList(event)\">\n\n	<mx:Script>\n		<![CDATA[\n			import mx.collections.ArrayCollection;\n			import mx.rpc.events.ResultEvent;\n\n			[Bindable]\n			private var ac:ArrayCollection;\n\n			private function onResult( e : ResultEvent ) :void\n			{\n				ac = e.result as ArrayCollection;\n			}\n\n			private function getList( e:Event ) :void\n			{\n				ws.list.send();\n			}\n\n		]]>\n	</mx:Script>\n\n	<mx:RemoteObject id=\"ws\" destination=\"ColdFusion\" source=\"CFisEasy.roles.data\">\n    	<mx:method name=\"list\" result=\"onResult(event)\" />\n	</mx:RemoteObject>\n\n	<mx:DataGrid left=\"10\" right=\"10\" top=\"10\" bottom=\"10\" dataProvider=\"{ac}\" />\n\n</mx:Application>\n</code>\n\n\n<p>But let\'s say that you instead wanted to interact with some sort of other interface like SMS, JMS, or as in the following example, an XMPP client using Gtalk:\n</p>\n<code><cffunction name=\"onIncomingMessage\" output=\"false\">\n    <cfargument name=\"incomingIM\" type=\"struct\" required=\"true\" />\n\n	<cfset var outgoingIM = StructNew() />\n    <cfset var data = createObject(\"Component\", \"data\") />\n	<cfset var people = data.list() />\n	<cfset var message =\"\" />\n\n	<cfloop query=\"people\">\n		<cfset message = message & \"#firstName# #lastName# #city# #state# #Chr(10)#\" />\n	</cfloop>\n\n	<cfset outgoingIM.BuddyID = arguments.incomingIM.Data.sender />\n	<cfset outgoingIM.Message = message />\n    <cfreturn outgoingIM />\n</cffunction>\n</code>\n\n<p>That\'s a lot of mileage out of that little query. From that simple query, I\'ve rendered a plain old HTML page, a ColdFusion AJAX display page, a custom written AJAX-driven page, a Flex display component, and a Gtalk Bot. That\'s what I mean by ColdFusion can play lots of roles.  It can do the whole thing, or just part of it.  Combine that with the concepts in my previous post, and ColdFusion can do the following:\n</p><ul><li>Act as a front end to business logic written in Java or .Net\n</li><li>Act as a back end to a front end written in Flex or HTML/Javascript\n</li><li>Act as a messenger from a back end written in Flex or Java to a front end written in Flex\n</li><li>Act as a messenger between all of these and a messaging service\n</li><li>And of course, it can be your front end, back end, and messenger all in one\n</li></ul><p>The idea here is that when you use ColdFusion, you can either use it full hog, or selectively swap in technologies that better address your needs.

To do that, I basically wanted to be able to dynamically call methods on the Java Math class.  Basically, I want to type \"pow 2 5\" in the IM client and have it be the equivalent of \"math.pow(2,5)\".\n</p><p>Calling Java dynamically from ColdFusion isn\'t straightforward.  But basically I figured if I could somehow use missing method to map calls to the underlying Java object then I could use cfinvoke to call the methods dynamically.  The downside is that I couldn\'t figure out any way to call Java dynamically without resorting to evaluate:\n</p>\n\n<code>\n<cfcomponent>\n\n<cffunction name=\"init\" access=\"public\" output=\"false\">\n	<cfargument name=\"path\" type=\"string\" required=\"true\" />\n	<cfset variables.javaProxy = CreateObject(\"java\", arguments.path) />\n	<cfreturn This />\n</cffunction>\n\n\n<cffunction access=\"public\" name=\"onMissingMethod\">\n	<cfargument name=\"missingMethodName\" />\n	<cfargument name=\"missingMethodArguments\" />\n\n	<cfset var attribute = \"\" />\n	<cfset var argumentList = \"\" />\n\n	<cfloop index=\"i\" from=\"1\" to=\"#ArrayLen(StructKeyArray(missingMethodArguments))#\" >\n		<cfset argumentList = ListAppend(argumentList, missingMethodArguments[i]) />\n	</cfloop>\n\n	<cfreturn Evaluate(\"variables.javaProxy.#missingMethodName#(#argumentList#)\") />\n</cffunction>\n\n</cfcomponent>\n</code>\n\n<p>Once you have that CFC, you can call it this way:\n</p>\n\n<code>\n<cfset math = CreateObject(\"component\", \"javaproxy\").init(\"java.lang.Math\") />\n<cfset method = \"pow\" />\n\n<cfinvoke component=\"#math#\" method=\"#method#\" returnvariable=\"result\">\n	<cfinvokeargument name=\"1\" value=\"2\" />\n	<cfinvokeargument name=\"2\" value=\"5\" />\n</cfinvoke>\n\n<cfoutput>#result#</cfoutput>\n</code>\n\n<p>Now, I\'m sure I\'ll get trounced for the use of the dreaded \"evaluate\", but it definitely got the job done for me.\n</p><p>I think the cool thing is that once you have your Java object proxied to a CFC you can extend it.

Hopefully this fills in more information for you.\n</p><p>Before I get into it though, let me just say that this isn\'t an attempt to excuse the problems you\'ve had.  We know that you had a crappy week last week (or this week), and regret it.  We do need to review what happened, and determine if we could have done this better.  Personally, in hindsight, there\'s one decision we should have gone another way on: we should have released the workaround sooner.\n</p><p><strong>Is it true that Adobe had a fix for months and sat on it?\n</strong></p><p>No, the issue was reported to us 7 weeks before exploits hit last week.\n</p><p><strong>The workaround was pretty easy, why did it take you six weeks to come up with?\n</strong></p><p>In this case, the issue was reported by a customer.  The customer was not satisfied with just a workaround for several reasons including concern that we were not actually fixing the correct problem. (This concern ended up being true.) Additionally, our security people were also not entirely convinced that the workaround was entirely the right solution. (Although, I need to state here that the workaround that is now circulating does close the security hole.)\n</p><p>For those reasons, a hotfix was the preferred solution.  A hotfix takes more time to create.  We had to create the hotfix, then test it to make sure it didn\'t break anything, and then provide it to the customer for their approval. We also had to communicate with the FCKEditor folks, to insure that we were correct in understanding their code.  In short in addition to testing there was a lot of communication between many groups, and that burned up the time.\n</p><p>Now let me be clear here, I\'m not casting blame on to the customer or any third party.  Communication takes time, and in this case it took a fair amount of time. If you want to know more about this process it\'s <a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/asset/2009/01/adobe_psirt_process_1.html\">publicly documented on the PSIRT blog</a>.\n</p><p><strong>Why didn\'t Adobe say anything at that time - the workaround was found pretty quickly?\n</strong></p><p>If we acknowledged the security vulnerability and released the workaround we\'d be leaving the reporting client in a lurch.  There would be public knowledge of a vulnerability, but no acceptable solution for our customer (as they required the hotfix solution.)  We made the call to make the fixes privately and announce when we had a solution we were confident in.\n</p><p>In this case it ended up biting us and you.  We now know we should have released the workaround as soon as we knew about it.\n</p><p>But honestly I\'m personally torn. On one hand, we should have told you guys sooner, as evidenced by the public exploits. On the other hand, we weren\'t arbitrarily holding it back, or idly sitting around - the security group was trying to get a proper fix out before an attack occurred. I think we just got some bad luck.\n</p><p>I\'m sure you have opinions on this.  Feel free to let me have it in the comments.\n</p><p><strong>Did the Adobe shutdown exacerbate this issue?\n</strong></p><p>The security response process was already in progress.  Our teams that work on patches were not off that week, so the actual fix was not delayed. The <a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/psirt/2009/07/potential_coldfusion_security.html\">Adobe Security team responded</a> within a day of the reported problem.  So I\'m not sure the shutdown had a large effect on our official responses.\n</p><p>If you have other questions, please feel free to ask them in the comments.   </p> ','Questions about the FCKEditor Vulnerability in ColdFusion','','publish','open','open','','questions-about-the-fckeditor-vulnerability-in-coldfusion','','','2009-07-06 08:24:00','2009-07-06 08:24:00','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/questions-about-the-fckeditor-vulnerability-in-coldfusion',0,'post','',11),(296,1,'2009-07-07 19:18:00','2009-07-07 19:18:00','<p>A couple people have told me they had no idea how to report a security issue in ColdFusion.

I take the class from an Illustrator comp, through Flash Catalyst, then Flash Builder, and Flex to a Flex Application, then on to an AIR application.  Because I\'m starting in Catalyst, when I get to the AIR application I don\'t really want to use AIR\'s chrome.  Rather, I\'d like to go chromeless and let the UI handle things like closing the application and whatnot.\n</p><p>I found a <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/communityengine/index.cfm?event=showdetails&amp;productId=4&amp;postId=8665\">good tutorial on doing chromeless AIR applications</a>.  But no matter what I tried, I couldn\'t get rid of this big blank whitespace in my application, despite following the directions to the letter.\n</p><p>After a lot of trial and error it turns out that the old way of making the Application background disappear using CSS (step 6 in the article) doesn\'t work with the new component model.

I\'m excited to hear what the community as a whole has to say about it.  One of my favorite features is ORM or Object Relational Mapping.\n</p><p>As I\'ve been traveling around for the user group tour, I\'ve heard a few questions about it, and I wanted to share these thoughts.\n</p><p><strong>Are you forcing us to use ORM?\n</strong></p><p>Absolutely not - cfquery and its related tags aren\'t going away.  ColdFusion is about making what you want to do easy. If you want to work with queries, work with queries--we\'ve made it pretty easy, as I\'ve said before.  But a number of customers wanted to work with databases in an easier, object-oriented way.  A lot of developer effort has gone into doing that with various ColdFusion Open Source projects. It makes sense then that we would strive to make this easy too.  That\'s \"too\" as in \"also,\" or \"additionally,\" or \"alternatively.\"  Or in other words, if you think ORM might have value, use it; if not, keep working the way that works for you because <strong>you are not required to use it</strong>.\n</p><p>In fact, we were actually able to expand the features of cfquery when we added ORM.  In order to use ORM you have to add a datasource to the This scope in your application.cfc.  Well when you do that, any cfquery in that application without a datasource tag will use the application.datasource. Very cool.\n</p><p><strong>Why do I have to set all of these properties?  Can\'t ColdFusion just look at the database and create an ORM object?\n</strong></p><p>Yes it can.  If you leave your CFC blank, ColdFusion will just map the table that you are pointing to, no questions asked.  However, if you want to set any properties manually, you\'ll have to set them all. So it\'s good for simple prototyping, but if you need to do something more complex, you have to do the work yourself.\n</p><p><strong>Why doesn\'t ORM return ColdFusion queries?\n</strong></p><p>Objects and tables don\'t always match up.  Queries are really good for exposing the results of a Select statement, but they aren\'t designed to handle complex sets of data. (Which is different from saying they cannot handle results of complex SQL Select statements, because they can.)\n</p><p>Sometimes you\'ve got complex relationships; sometimes you have tables that are set up for one purpose, but used for another; and sometimes you have multiple tables that really should be one object.  Queries can certainly accommodate this, but ORM can often do it in a way that makes you more productive. What would be multiple queries that you have to manage and loop through to display using queries, becomes one object in ORM.\n</p><p>Now add to it that you can add business logic to these objects, things like calculations, display formatting, and combined properties... and ORM shows itself to be much more valuable than just another way of handling data.\n</p><p>Okay, and let\'s say you REEEAAAAALLLLY want a query. Okay, you can run a function named EntityToQuery that will convert the results of an ORM operation to a query.  (Provided that it\'s a simple object, with no relationships or other funny business.)  (Not valid in Australia, for people named Mark, with or without marsupial pouches.)\n</p><p><strong>Where can I find out more about ORM in ColdFusion 9?\n</strong></p><p>There are a few good blog posts and articles on the subject:\n</p><ul><li>Ben Forta\'s <a href=\"http://forta.com/blog/index.cfm/2009/7/7/ORM-Rethinking-ColdFusion-Database-Integration\">ORM - Rethinking ColdFusion Database Integration</a>\n		</li><li>Mark Mandel\'s <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/coldfusion/articles/coldfusion9_orm.html\">Introducing ORM in Adobe ColdFusion 9 beta</a>\n		</li><li><a href=\"http://www.objectorientedcoldfusion.org/post.cfm/what-coldfusion-9-s-orm-means-for-your-development\">What ColdFusion 9\'s ORM means for your development</a>\n		</li></ul><p>I\'ll try to add them as I see them.\n</p><p>\n </p> ','Questions about ORM in ColdFusion 9','','publish','open','open','','questions-about-orm-in-coldfusion-9','','','2009-07-13 05:15:00','2009-07-13 05:15:00','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/questions-about-orm-in-coldfusion-9',0,'post','',1),(302,1,'2009-07-13 07:13:00','2009-07-13 07:13:00','<p>We\'ve been promising this one for awhile, but today we deliver.

However, it would be disingenuous of me to not acknowledge that there are tools that have stolen the spotlight away from ColdFusion.  For me, this release of ColdFusion is about getting that spotlight back.\n</p><p>I was thinking about the phrase \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration\">convention over configuration</a>\" which seems to be the prevailing philosophy behind other RAD tools, like Ruby on Rails, Grails, Zend, etc. To me it means, \"<em>Code the way we tell you to, and we\'ll make it fast.</em>\" It\'s hard to tell tone here, but I\'m not trying to knock this.  A lot of smart people have done some awesome work with this mindset.\n</p><p>However, it never really fit with me, both when I was using frameworks and when I was writing them.  People almost always chafe at the conventions.  People always think they themselves can do things better then someone else. Not just me, in this case, but the people I was trying to get to use conventions. Some of that thinking is misguided. Some of it is \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here\">Not Invented Here</a>\" thinking.  But at the end of the day, you\'re always going to be more productive using something you believe in, rather than something you\'re somehow compelled to use.\n</p><p>This leads me to the features of ColdFusion 9 and ColdFusion Builder.\n</p><p>ColdFusion Builder comes with extensions that generate code for you. Want to quickly generate code for viewing information in your database?  You can do that. Hate the code we generate? You can completely change it. It\'s written in CFML, and completely visible/editable to you.\n</p><p>Want to quickly build a modern, responsive HTML UI?  You can use our built in UI components. Want to hand-code your front end using a JavaScript framework? Here\'s CFAjaxProxy and our JSON features from ColdFusion 8 for you.\n</p><p>Want to do your front end in Flex? You can have it faster. Want to use ColdFusion in Flex quickly? You can use Exposed Services.\n</p><p>Want to work with PDFs?  You\'ve had that. Want to work with Office files? Now you can do that too.\n</p><p>We\'ve added Hibernate ORM to ColdFusion.  Want to wire up an object model in ColdFusion, and just have the CFCs define the database? You can do that.  Want to model an existing database ignoring its structure, and instead building proper objects regardless of underlying structure? Guess what? Doable. Want to just provide CRUD for your existing database without writing a lot of code? You can just leave your ORM CFCs blank, and we\'ll take care of that for you.\n</p><p>Don\'t like ORM? That\'s fine, CFQuery isn\'t going away. We\'ve tweaked it a bit, to use the application.datasource by default.  Also, the code generation tools we provide will generate CFQuery code for you instead of ORM code. Don\'t like the code we generated... you should get the point by now.\n</p><p>The point being this: instead of saying <em>\"Code the way we tell you to and we\'ll make it fast\"</em> ColdFusion is saying <em>\"Code the way you want, we\'ll make it fast.\"</em> That is what I mean by RAD without Rules.\"\n</p><p>   </p> ','RAD without Rules','','publish','open','open','','rad-without-rules','','','2009-07-14 08:24:00','2009-07-14 08:24:00','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/rad-without-rules',0,'post','',1),(305,1,'2009-07-14 09:48:00','2009-07-14 09:48:00','<p>A number of people have commented on the lack of word or line wrapping in ColdFusion.

The second &lt;cfoutput&gt; will show the time from the actual time the code is called.  The 1 for timespan means that it will cache that value for a day.\n</p><p>But, we can also do dependent cached items, where the value of one of the contained variables has an impact on whether or not the cached item needs to be refreshed.\n</p>\n\n<code>\n<cfset minutesVariable = minute(now()) />\n\n<cfcache action=\"serverCache\" dependson=\"minutesVariable\">\n	<cfoutput>\n		<p>The minutes is #minutesVariable#</p>\n\n		<p>The time was #DateFormat(Now(), \"mmmm d, yyyy\")#\n		#TimeFormat(Now(), \"hh:mm:ss tt\")#</p>\n	</cfoutput>\n</cfcache>\n</code>\n\n<p>In the above code, assume that it is called at 12:03.  For the next minute minutesVariable is going to equal 3. For each call where minutesVariable equals 3 the cache is used. However when the time rolls over to 12:04, minutesVariable will equal 4. This will trigger a refreshing of the cache with the new content being cached for the next minute.\n</p><p>In addition to fragments, I can also cache objects (but for easy of understanding, variables) See this code:\n</p>\n\n<code>\n<cfcache action=\"get\" name=\"test\" id=\"testQuery\">\n\n<cfif not structkeyExists(variables, \"test\")>\n	<cfquery name=\"test\" datasource=\"cfartgallery\">\n		SELECT 	*\n		FROM 	Artists\n	</cfquery>\n	<cfcache action=\"put\" value=\"#test#\" id=\"testQuery\">\n</cfif>\n<cfdump var=\"#test#\">\n</code>\n\n<p>I try and retrieve the query that I\'ve given an id of \"testQuery\" from cache, if it\'s not there, I call the query and cache it.\n</p><p>So those are three fairly straight forward examples of the new caching, but you can do much more with it, including invalidating objects, analyzing cache usage, and more.\n</p><p>\n </p><p>\n </p><p>\n </p> ','Caching Enhancements in ColdFusion 9','','publish','open','open','','caching-enhancements-in-coldfusion-9','','','2009-07-17 11:03:00','2009-07-17 11:03:00','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/caching-enhancements-in-coldfusion-9',0,'post','',22),(309,1,'2009-07-20 14:25:00','2009-07-20 14:25:00','<p>Another of the less visible, but still cool features in ColdFusion 9 are the enhancements we\'ve made to &lt;cfpdf&gt;.  We\'ve added the ability to:\n</p><ul><li>Add headers/footers to existing PDFs\n</li><li>Create PDF packages\n</li><li>Selectively optimize PDF size\n</li><li>Extract text from PDFs\n</li><li>Extract images from PDFs\n</li><li>Create high quality thumbnails\n</li></ul><p> Of these features, my personal favorites are optimization and extraction.\n</p><p><strong>Optimization</strong>\n</p><p>PDFs can do a lot.  Consequently, PDFs size can swell due to the presence of extra information, metadata, and embedded files.  The optimize feature allows you to remove specific types of extras in order to selectively reduce the size of your PDF.  But you can retain features that you need.  When you take action=\"optimize\" the following options are open to you:\n</p><ul><li>noattachments\n</li><li>nobookmarks\n</li><li>nocomments\n</li><li>nofonts\n</li><li>nojavascript\n</li><li>nolinks\n</li><li>nometadata\n</li><li>nothumbnails\n</li></ul><p>Code looks like this:\n</p>\n\n\n<code>\n<cfpdf 	action=\"optimize\"\n		source=\"#ExpandPath(\'./UserGroupTour2009.pdf\')#\"\n		destination=\"#ExpandPath(\'./UserGroupTour2009Opt.pdf\')#\"\n		noattachments = true\n		nobookmarks = true\n		nocomments = true\n		nofonts = true\n		nojavascripts = true\n		nolinks = true\n		nometadata = true\n		/>\n</code>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see, the code is pretty straightforward.

I was fooling around with the ColdFusion\'s ability to turn Word docs into PDFs. At first glance it\'s pretty simple and straightforward:\n</p>\n\n<code>\n<cfset src = expandPath(\"./cf9.docx\") />\n<cfset result = expandPath(\"./cf9.pdf\") />\n<cfdocument filename=\"#result#\" srcfile=\"#src#\" format=\"pdf\" />\n</code>\n\n\n<p>Word to PDF is nice to have, but as features go, it\'s a pretty small bullet point. Don\'t get me wrong, you get fidelity to the original, including fonts, layouts, and images.  But it\'s still just converting a Word document to a PDF.\n</p><p>That is until you remember that you can pull content out of PDFs now in ColdFusion 9.  So now you can do this:</p>\n\n<code>\n<cfset src = expandPath(\"./cf9.docx\") />\n<cfset result = expandPath(\"./cf9.pdf\") />\n<cfdocument filename=\"#result#\" srcfile=\"#src#\" format=\"pdf\" overwrite=\"true\" />\n\n<cfpdf action=\"extracttext\"\n		source=\"#result#\"\n		name=\"cfref\"\n		  />\n\n<cfdump var=\"#XMLparse(cfref)#\" >\n\n</code>\n\n\n<p>This will yield you the content of the original Word document.

I had to simplify his stuff to wrap my mind around it enough to talk about it. So hats off to Jayesh, he\'s done some awesome work here.\n</p>\n<p>I was doing a demo on ColdFusion and AIR integration at the keynote for CFUnited, and I figured I would go into a little more detail here.\n</p>\n<p>First off, to call it \"ColdFusion and AIR integration\" is to do it a bit of a disservice.  What our engineers have accomplished is nothing short of \"ORM for AIR.\" It handles:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Creating and maintaining the SQLite database\n</li>\n<li>Saving objects to SQLite without SQL statements\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>Handling relationships:\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li>one-to-one\n</li>\n<li>one-to-many\n</li>\n<li>many-to-one\n</li>\n<li>many-to-many\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Syncing those records back to ColdFusion\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So I have a sample application that shows a basic demo of this, without the relationships. Jayesh\'s demo has the relationships. I\'ve attached the code here, so if you want to look at it, just download the whole thing. Otherwise, let me take you through it.  One little note, this stuff was written for ColdFusion 9 Beta.  There are some bugs.  I\'ll point them out where I can, and assure you that the bugs are being worked on.\n</p>\n<p>So let\'s start in the ColdFusion.  First I define an ORM cfc:\n</p>\n<p>\n<code>\ncomponent persistent=\"true\"{\n	property name=\"personID\" fieldtype=\"id\";\n	property name=\"firstName\";\n	property name=\"lastName\";\n	property name=\"twitter\";\n\n	public string function serial(){\n		return \"#This.getFirstName()#|#This.getLastName()#|#This.getTwitter()#|#This.getpersonID()#\";\n	}\n}\n</code></p>\n<p>Pretty straightforward; then I define a corresponding ActionScript class:\n</p>\n<p>\n\n<code>\npackage airdemo\n{\n	[Bindable]\n	[RemoteClass(alias=\"AIRDemo.person\")]\n	[Entity]\n	public class Person\n	{\n		[Id]\n        public var personID:int;\n        public var firstName:String;\n        public var lastName:String;\n        public var twitter:String;\n	}\n}\n</code></p>\n<p>Note the RemoteClass mapping to the CFC on the back end. Now let\'s go to the application.  I have a simple data grid and form designed to show and edit the details of these person objects. I\'ll skip that and go right to the part where I hook up AIR to the ColdFusion server:\n</p>\n<p>\n\n<code>\nprivate function init():void\n{\n	// Provide Credentials for Server side Connection and CFC\n	syncmanager = new SyncManager();\n	syncmanager.cfPort = 80;\n	syncmanager.cfServer = \"centaur.dev\";\n	syncmanager.syncCFC = \"AirDemo.personManager\";\n\n	// THis handler will be called when any COnflict\n	// occurs while writing back changes on serverside\n	syncmanager.addEventListener(ConflictEvent.CONFLICT, conflictHandler);\n\n	//Kick off the application.\n	getRemote();\n\n}\n</code></p>\n<p>This connects this application to the ColdFusion server <em>centaur.dev</em> on port <em>80</em> and wires the <em>syncmanager</em> to <em>AIRDemo.personmanager</em>. More on that later.  But it also kicks off <em>getRemote </em>which takes care of populating this application with data from the server.  So <em>getRemote</em>() fires:\n</p>\n<p>\n<code>\n//GET records from BACKEND SERVER\nprivate function getRemote():void{\n	var token:AsyncToken= syncmanager.fetch(\"fetch\");\n	token.addResponder(new mx.rpc.Responder(fetchSuccess, fetchFault));\n}\n</code></p>\n<p>Syncmanager.fetch calls the <em>fetch</em> method of the ColdFusion CFC we set as <em>syncmanager.syncCFC </em>above.  That method just retrieves the records using ColdFusion ORM.\n</p>\n<p>\n\n<code>\nremote Array function fetch(){\n	return EntityLoad(\'person\');;\n}\n</code></p>\n<p>In most cases it is successful, in which case fetchSuccess calls createLocalDB:\n</p>\n<p>\n\n<code>\n//CREATE the actual SQLite DB\nprivate function createLocalDB():void{\n	//Create a pointer to actual SQLite db file\n	dbFile = File.userDirectory.resolvePath(\"AirDemo.db\");\n\n	var sessiontoken:SessionToken =syncmanager.openSession(dbFile,017916);\n	sessiontoken.addResponder(new mx.rpc.Responder(connectSuccess,connectFault));\n}\n</code></p>\n<p>In most cases that is successful and connectSuccess calls <em>createLocalCacheFromRemote\n</em></p>\n<p>\n\n<code>\n//PUT records from BACKEND SERVER in SQLite DB\nprivate function createLocalCacheFromRemote():void{\n	var savetoken:SessionToken = session.saveUpdateCache(pc);\n	savetoken.addResponder(new mx.rpc.Responder(saveCacheSuccess, savefault));\n}\n</code></p>\n<p>Those three ActionScript functions in concert with the ColdFusion one:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Got the data from the ColdFusion server\n</li>\n<li>Created a local SQLite database for the data\n</li>\n<li>Populated the local SQLite data with that data\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Okay, so now I go through the application, update some data, and want to save it back to the SQLite database:\n</p>\n<p>\n<code>\n//SAVE to SQLite DB\nprivate function saveLocal():void\n{\n	//Generate person object from form.\n	var person:Person = convertFormToObject();\n\n	//session.saveUpdate saves record to SQLite Database\n	var savetoken:SessionToken = session.saveUpdate(person);\n	savetoken.addResponder(new mx.rpc.Responder(saveSuccess, savefault));\n}\n</code></p>\n<p>ConvertFormToObject does exactly what it sounds like, converting values from a form into a Person object, then session.saveUpdate() handles saving the record back to the SQLite store. No SQL required.  Then we need to send it off to the ColdFusion server:\n</p>\n<p>\n\n<code>\n//SAVE to BACKEND SERVER\nprivate function saveRemote():void\n{\n	var committoken:SessionToken = session.commit();\n	committoken.addResponder(new mx.rpc.Responder(commitSuccess, commitFault));\n}\n</code></p>\n<p>That\'s it.  That transmits all of that changes made in this session to the ColdFusion server, where it is processed:\n</p>\n<p>\n\n<code>\nremote any function sync(required array operations,\n								required array clientobjects,\n								array originalobjects = ArrayNew(1)){\n\n		var i= 0;\n		var conflicts = ArrayNew(1);\n		var conflictcount = 1;\n\n		for (i=1; i &lt;= ArrayLen(operations); i++ ){\n\n			var operation = operations[i];\n			var clientobject = clientobjects[i];\n			var originalobject = originalobjects[i];\n\n			if (operation eq \"INSERT\" ){\n				var obj = ORMGetSession().merge(clientobject);\n				EntitySave(obj);\n			}\n			else{\n\n				if (isinstanceOf(originalobject,\"person\")){\n					var serverobject = EntityLoadByPK(\"person\",originalobject.getpersonID());\n				}\n				else{\n					throw \"Invalid Object\";\n				}\n\n				if (not isdefined(\'serverobject\')){\n						var text=\"CONFLICT::SERVER OBJECT NOT FOUND, RECORD MAY BE DELETED ALREADY\";\n						var conflict = New CFIDE.AIR.conflict();\n						conflict.clientobject = clientobject;\n						conflict.originalobject = originalobject;\n						conflict.operation = operation;\n						conflicts[conflictcount++] = conflict;\n						continue;\n				}\n\n				var isNotConflict = (originalobject.serial() eq  serverobject.serial());\n				if (isNotConflict){\n						if (operation eq \"UPDATE\"){\n							obj = ORMGetSession().merge(clientobject);\n							EntitySave(obj);\n						}\n						else if (operation eq \"DELETE\"){\n							obj = ORMGetSession().merge(originalobject);\n							EntityDelete(obj);\n						}\n				}\n				else{\n						var text=\"is a conflict\";\n						var conflict = New CFIDE.AIR.conflict();\n						conflict.clientobject = clientobject;\n						conflict.originalobject = originalobject;\n						conflict.operation = operation;\n						conflicts[conflictcount++] = conflict;\n						continue;\n				}\n			}\n		}\n		if (conflictcount gt 1){\n	   		return conflicts;\n		}\n	}\n}\n</code></p>\n<p>So this is a lot of code, but basically it performs the following steps:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div>Check to see if the record is new\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li>If so insert it\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>Then check to see if the update is in conflict\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li>If not, delete or update accordingly\n</li>\n<li>If so, send a conflict back to the AIR client\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now back in the client you have to handle the conflict, in this version of the application, I just replace the client details with the server details:\n</p>\n<p>\n<code>\n//OVERWRITE from  BACKEND SERVER\npublic function conflictOverwrite(conflicts:ArrayCollection):void{\n	var token:SessionToken = session.keepAllServerObjects(conflicts);\n	token.addResponder(new mx.rpc.Responder(conflictSuccess, conflictFault));\n}\n</code></p>\n<p>Again, one function, <em>session.keepAllServerObjects,</em> handles overwriting everything on the client.\n</p>\n<p>So that is the gist of what I was going to show at CFUnited.

They can\'t really.  To do so one has to fully understand the application architecture design, building, and coding process. In most cases to understand that you have to be a developer capable of it.  If you are a developer capable of it, why are you hiring others?   All this leads to the guy or gal in front of you asking you to change \"just this little thing.\"\n</p><p>People do it because people tend to think anything they don\'t know how to do is easy. I think this is because our touch points with each other\'s disciplines are so small and shallow. Our work is all icebergs. There is a little that can be seen, but underneath the surface it goes on and on.\n</p><p>What does this have to do with design?\n</p><p>The other day a typography site named <a href=\"http://typedia.com/\">Typedia.com</a> launched. I follow a couple of the founders, and thought it was a cool idea.  Then I happened to read a <a href=\"http://typedia.com/blog/post/behind-the-typedia-logo-design/\">blog entry from the guy who designed the logo</a>. (He\'s <a href=\"http://www.johnlangdon.net/\">John Langdon</a> by the way, who did the ambigrams for the Dan Brown novel <em>Angels and Demons</em>.)  In it he talks about the logo and the process of creating what is essentially a custom font for it.\n</p><p><a href=\"http://typedia.com/i/screen/logo.gif\">Look at the logo</a>.  Did you have any idea that there were volumes and volumes of thought behind that logo, dating back to the invention of the printing press?  I certainly didn\'t.\n</p><p>Which leads me to think about the hundreds of fonts on my system (working for Adobe has its perks.)  Each one of them contains some measure of this thought. Each of them is an iceberg too.\n</p><p>This leads me to think that every design comp I\'ve ever seen is also an iceberg with hours of thought and volumes of reference and knowledge behind it.   Makes me wonder about the push back I\'ve given.\n</p><p>This does not lead me to say that all of these icebergs mean that I should not criticize other people\'s work, or ask for changes.  Volumes of content condensed into the wrong logo are still wrong, as John Langdon\'s post reveals. It also does not make me naïve enough to think that every comp has had hours put into it, just that there are hours of expertise leading up to it.\n</p><p>It leads me to the thought that we need to be more mindful of the fact that what other people produce is not only what we see, but the accumulation of their expertise.  We as developers need to see it when we look at the work of designers.  We also need to see it when we look at the work of other developers.  Once we do that we just need to go out and convince the rest of the world to look at our work that way. How we do that is a mystery to me, but I suppose it starts with doing it ourselves.\n</p><p>  </p> ','Icebergs','','publish','open','open','','icebergs','','','2009-08-25 07:22:00','2009-08-25 07:22:00','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/icebergs',0,'post','',6),(324,1,'2009-09-08 12:33:00','2009-09-08 12:33:00','<p>I thought I had seen the best discount for MAX a few weeks ago, when I blogged about the <a href=\"http://www.terrenceryan.com/blog/index.cfm/2009/8/19/Max-2009-Discount\">educational/governmental/non-profit discount</a>.

He\'s a longtime PHP developer and has recently dipped his toes into the ColdFusion waters. He recently developed the MAX widget that\'s been going around. In fact, he used ColdFusion to power it. Here are his thoughts on the matter:\n</p><blockquote><p>...I\'m fairly new to ColdFusion. I actually first touched CF about a year a go on the On AIR Train Tour through Europe. That was the first time I played around with CF after oh... some 10 years of working with PHP. I looked at CF a few years ago and never really took another serious look at it. I\'m sure there are many of you out there in the same situation and I would like to invite you to take another look at ColdFusion. CF has changed and matured a lot since the early days and is just a breeze to work with. With a minimum amount of code, I was able to rapidly code my database calls for the widget. Another cool thing about ColdFusion is that once you write your database code, you can use it in a number of different ways. You can directly call the methods using Flash Remoting in your Flex application, call it as a webservice from a mobile Flash application and/or call it from an HTML page without changing anything in the original code. I surely was pretty impressed when I saw that the first time. If you\'re a long time PHP user and want to know more about ColdFusion, I\'d like to invite you to my session at MAX. I\'m going to talk about the difference and similarities between PHP and CF and also talk about what CF can do right out of the box....\n</p></blockquote><p>If you want to find out more about his <a href=\"http://www.webkitchen.be/2009/09/15/behind-the-scenes-of-the-max-widget-coldfusion-fms-and-flex/\">experience with the widget, check out the rest of the article</a>.</p> ','ColdFusion Thoughts from a Longtime PHP developer','','publish','open','open','','coldfusion-thoughts-from-a-longtime-php-developer','','','2009-09-16 07:39:00','2009-09-16 07:39:00','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/coldfusion-thoughts-from-a-longtime-php-developer',0,'post','',1),(329,1,'2009-09-18 09:18:44','2009-09-18 09:18:44','<p>I made a few major changes to my site in one fell swoop. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Changed to a VPS </li>\n<li>Upgraded to <a href=\"http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/coldfusion9/\">ColdFusion 9</a> </li>\n<li>Changed blog to <a href=\"http://www.mangoblog.org/\">Mango Blog</a> </li>\n<li>Changed version control to <a href=\"http://git-scm.com/\">git</a> </li>\n</ul>\n<p>A few people asked me questions about the changes so I figured I would explain. </p>\n<p><strong>Why a VPS? </strong></p>\n<p>I really like my hosting company, <a href=\"http://yohost.com/\">YoHost</a>, but it was still shared hosting. That meant I couldn\'t experiment with administrative settings and whatnot. Also I was constrained to my hosting provider\'s upgrade schedule. Changing to a VPS meant that I can do whatever I want whenever I want. I like that freedom. </p>\n<p><strong>Why ColdFusion 9? </strong></p>\n<p>You mean other than that I am an evangelist for it? Well I actually used a few pieces of it. I built an admin piece for my <a href=\"/events.cfm\">events page</a> using ORM and ColdFusion Builder\'s code generation. I also added a page that pulls in my <a href=\"/presentations.cfm\">presentations</a> from <a href=\"http://slidesix.com/\">SlideSix</a>. To not tax their servers too much, I used the new caching features of ColdFusion. So I\'m not just using ColdFusion 9 to use it, I\'m leveraging some of the features. </p>\n<p><strong>Why Mango Blog? </strong></p>\n<p>First off let me just say, I love Ray Camden. I\'d go so far as to say I have a non-sexual man-crush on him. That being said, I went to Mango Blog. I\'ve been using it in our internal blog that <a href=\"http://www.mangoblog.org/news/review-by-ben-forta-mango-blog-is-truly-impressive\">Ben talked about a while back</a>. There are a few things that I completely love. I love the rich text editor. I love the plugin architecture. I love the caching. I love the skinning. It\'s fantastic. Those were my big motivators. I felt that even with the changes I made to the default Mango Blog install I could easily keep it up to date, whereas I felt extreme apprehension about updating BlogCFC because of all of the changes I made to code to make it work the way I wanted. To be clear, I had to tweak both, it\'s just that my Mango tweaks were mostly in a skin, which won\'t get changed by future updates. </p>\n<p><strong>Why git? </strong></p>\n<p>Because I want to be one of the cool kids who\'s all like \"Subversion, oh yeah I did that like 8 years ago, I feel so bad for you for using a mature technology that you can rely on.\" </p>\n<p>Okay maybe not. The big motivator for me for git was online/offline changes. I often work without a good network connection. Being able to work properly, with multiple check ins even without connectivity was killer. I also appreciate the fact that the metadata is in one place. This makes copying the project during a build feasible instead of a network intensive svn export. This reduced my build process for my site from 3 or so minutes to 30 seconds. This means I\'m more likely to update more often. </p>\n<p>So there you go. This was a very practical upgrade for me, I got a lot out of it, and I have a few reports that the site is even faster then it was before.

I am not too familiar with Hibernate but go through Rails Envy once in awhile :-)\n</em></p>\n<p>This is an awesome question, and I\'m going to tackle it, but I\'m going to break it into a few sub questions.  Before I do that, this is comparing apples to oranges.  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record_pattern\">Active Record</a> is a pattern and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibernate_%28Java%29\">Hibernate</a> is an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping\">ORM</a> solution that uses a pattern named <a href=\"http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/dataMapper.html\">Data Mapper</a>.  I can\'t speak to the entire reason for choosing Hibernate, as I\'m not one of the engineers, but a quick survey shows it is the leading ORM solution in Java right now, which pushed us that way.\n</p>\n<p><strong>What are the differences between Data Mapper and Active Record?\n</strong></p>\n<p>The underlying one seems to be a philosophical one:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Data Mapper looks to the objects to be the definition of the data; the database is just a place to store it.\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>Active Record looks to the database to be the definition of the data; the object is just a way to access it.\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That\'s an oversimplification I\'m sure. Data Mapper requires you to map out each table and each column. Active Record by and large will detect things like tables and columns for you and expose them.  Implementations of both patterns include the ability to tweak the configuration, but it looks like most Data Mapper implementations need to be configured. (As opposed to Active Record implementations like Rails that prefer convention over configuration.)\n</p>\n<p>A practical consideration that occurs is that Active Record objects handle talking to the database with load, save, and delete methods; while Data Mapper objects get passed back to another object or function to translation back to the database.\n</p>\n<p>There are also issues about performance and mapping.  I won\'t bother going into these as they are issues with implementation of the pattern and not the pattern itself.\n</p>\n<p><strong>Why did you go with Data Mapper over Active Record?\n</strong></p>\n<p>Two major reasons here:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Hibernate uses the Data Mapper pattern\n</li>\n<li>Because the community (represented on the prerelease site) by and large asked for it.\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I don\'t remember the entire rationale behind this preference, but I will push responsibility on to the prerelease testers. :) I think it is related to the two next issues.\n</p>\n<p><strong>Is ColdFusion ORM pure Data Mapper?\n</strong></p>\n<p>Not necessarily. Sure you create CFCs with properties. You then use the Entity functions to save them back to the database. You can have those properties actually create and update your database structure. That is clearly Data Mapper in action.\n</p>\n<p>However, you can leave all of the properties in your CFCs blank, and ColdFusion will just populate it from the database.  You can leave some of the details of your properties blank and ColdFusion will make assumptions about how they\'re typed.  These are philosophically Active Record features.\n</p>\n<p>It comes down to ColdFusion making stuff easier, regardless of underlying philosophy.  ColdFusion does both, to facilitate both database-focused and object-focused ORM implementations.\n</p>\n<p><strong>Can you create Active Record CFCs with ColdFusion 9\'s ORM?\n</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. You can wrap the Entity functions in a CFC like this:\n</p>\n<p><code>\n\n\n</code></p>\n<pre><pre>&lt;cffunction name=\"save\" access=\"public\" returntype=\"void\"&gt;</pre>\n<pre> &lt;cfset EntitySave(This) /&gt;</pre>\n<pre>&lt;/cffunction&gt;</pre>\n<br /></pre>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once you do that you can call your objects using the active record pattern of object.save(). In fact Bob Silverberg has started work on an Active Record CFC that you can just have all of your CFCs inherit from <a href=\"http://basepersistentobject.riaforge.org/\">called Base Persistent ORM Object (Active.)</a>\n	</p>\n<p>So hopefully this answered some of the questions around Hibernate, the Data Mapper pattern and the Active Record pattern in ColdFusion 9.  </p>','ColdFusion 9 ORM: Data Mapper versus Active Record','','publish','open','open','','coldfusion-9-orm-data-mapper-versus-active-record','','','2009-09-18 12:25:07','2009-09-18 12:25:07','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/coldfusion-9-orm-data-mapper-versus-active-record',0,'post','',6),(331,1,'2009-09-28 10:34:43','2009-09-28 10:34:43','<p>There\'s an open position for a ColdFusion Developer at the University of Denver.

However this does not mean you are restricted to one <strong>database, schema</strong> or <strong>tablespace</strong>. <br /><br />A datasource is just an abstraction for database connection details. It takes a server, a port, user credentials, a default database and other information.  On the database side, just because a database is defaulted doesn\'t mean that you are limited to just that database.  In SQL you can append schema namespaces to the front of a table:<br /><br class=\"unstyled\" />SELECT *<br />FROM NotMyDefaultApplication..users<br /><br />This can also be accomplished in ORM components by specifying the schema attribute on the component. This will allow you to access a table outside the default database.<br /><br />So if you have the need to access multiple databases/tablespaces/schema on one database server you absolutely can with the proper credentials and the schema attribute. </p>','Multiple Databases in ColdFusion 9 ORM','','publish','open','open','','multiple-databases-in-coldfusion-9-orm','','','2009-10-07 12:33:49','2009-10-07 12:33:49','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/multiple-databases-in-coldfusion-9-orm',0,'post','',16),(337,1,'2009-10-27 17:39:01','2009-10-27 17:39:01','<p>They just added a few new tutorials I did at <a href=\"http://tv.adobe.com/\">Adobe TV</a>.\n</p>\n<p>Displaying Flash Video Files in ColdFusion 9:<br /><a href=\"http://tv.adobe.com/watch/adc-presents/displaying-flash-video-files-in-coldfusion-9/\">http://tv.adobe.com/watch/adc-presents/displaying-flash-video-files-in-coldfusion-9/</a>\n	</p>\n<p>Extending ColdFusion Builder:<br /><a href=\"http://tv.adobe.com/watch/adc-presents/extending-coldfusion-builder/\" target=\"_blank\">http://tv.adobe.com/watch/adc-presents/extending-coldfusion-builder/</a></p>\n<p>PDF Content Manipulation with ColdFusion 9:<br /><a href=\"http://tv.adobe.com/watch/adc-presents/pdf-file-content-manipulation-with-coldfusion-9\">http://tv.adobe.com/watch/adc-presents/pdf-file-content-manipulation-with-coldfusion-9</a></p>','New ColdFusion 9 Videos at Adobe TV','','publish','open','open','','new-coldfusion-9-videos-at-adobe-tv','','','2009-10-27 17:39:01','2009-10-27 17:39:01','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/new-coldfusion-9-videos-at-adobe-tv',0,'post','',2),(338,1,'2009-10-27 17:48:00','2009-10-27 17:48:00','<p>This got lost a little in the shuffle around MAX.

He talked about how it went on for line after line, after line. I figured he was talking about something in the order of magnitude of about 2 or 3 times as much code.\n</p>\n<p>He forwarded me a post on <a href=\"http://www.aviransplace.com/2008/01/08/make-http-post-or-get-request-from-java/\">making HTTP GET and POST requests in Java</a>.   As the post shows it takes 12 lines of code just to import all of the classes you need.  When you\'re all said and done it takes about 30 or so lines of code to actually make a GET request.  So it takes about 42 lines of Java code to duplicate the functionally that can be called in 1 line of ColdFusion using CFHTTP.  I never noticed it was that big a difference. All that versus:\n</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Now, I\'m sure there are easier ways of doing this. And after you build the class and method once, you can just reuse the object repeatedly.  But in this day and age of SOA, SOAP, and REST, that seems like something that should be built into the language.\n</p>\n<p>I\'m not trying to make this a bash Java post. Really I\'m not.  Java can do lots of things ColdFusion cannot. In fact Java networking is this verbose because it has more options; it can do low level socket communication.  I know, when I\'ve needed it in ColdFusion, I\'ve dropped down to Java to write it.\n</p>\n<p>But as developers, I think there are lots of places where we don\'t add value, but are still forced to work:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Getting reporting data out of a database? You add value by writing good complex SQL, but not by writing the database connection code.\n</li>\n<li>In basic database applications, you add value by designing the database, but not by writing CRUD code.\n</li>\n<li>In a REST and SOAP world, you add value by mashing up services people have thought of combining, not by making the HTTP call to get the data.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I know frameworks, libraries, code reuse, and other encapsulation techniques are ways around this.\n</p>\n<p>ColdFusion as an abstraction layer on top of Java is another way.  It\'s the way I do it.  And because I do it that way, I never have to write more code then I have to for an HTTP GET request, or email, or database connection, or .NET integration, or Exchange call, or Spreadsheet creation, or …\n</p>\n<p> </p>','CFHTTP equivalent in Java.

I am convinced that no other single feature of the IDE is as valuable as this. (And I love the rest of the features too, so I\'m saying a lot here.) The ability to leverage ColdFusion know-how and features into tooling is awesome. A lot of the extensions we\'ve shown off have been about code generation.  I think that\'s important, as it is big part of the Builder story.  We make you more productive, but you make yourself even more productive.  Of late though, I\'ve been focused on extensions that do more than just generate code, they use ColdFusion capabilities in non-obvious ways.  I\'ll be posting them over the next few weeks.\n</p>\n<p>Here\'s the first:\n</p>\n<p>I created a language translator that allows you to translate content in the editor window to other languages.  As a first pass, it only does English, French, German, and Italian, but as I experiment I will expand them.  To use:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the Editor window, highlight the content you want to translate\n</li>\n<li>Right-click it to bring up the context menu\n</li>\n<li>Choose Google Language Tools -&gt; Translate\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That should drop the translated content back into your editor, below the original content.\n</p>\n<p>To build this I used a few different pieces. In the last Public Beta drop of ColdFusion we added the ability to grab highlighted content from the editor window in a ColdFusion Builder extension.  I take that highlighted content and pass it to the server.  On the server I pass it to a CFC that I wrote that consumes the <a href=\"http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxlanguage/documentation/\">Google Language API</a>. It\'s a JSON-powered webservice, so I used ColdFusion support for JSON to simply get at this data. From there, I can use a feature of ColdFusion Builder called \"callbacks\" to write the translated code back to the editor window.  Specifically, I used the \"inserttext\" callback, which allows me to insert text at a specific line of code.  I can use this to carefully place the translated text.\n</p>\n<p>Possible use cases:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Translating HTML content to multiple languages\n</li>\n<li>Translating code comments to your native language\n</li>\n<li>Creating language packs for your applications\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sound cool?

It came about due to severe jet lag in Sydney and a need to do something cool for cf.Objective ANZ.\n</p>\n<p>So imagine you\'re a freelancer who is no longer in an office, able to get instant feedback on a piece of code. I know the feeling.  Wouldn\'t it be cool if you could do that through the IDE?  Well this extension will do that.  Highlight a piece of code in your editor window, right click, and choose Instant Code review.  A list of your currently online buddies will pop up, and you choose them and write out a comment.  Your code and comment will be sent via IM. Your IM buddy can respond to it.   That response will get written as a comment in your source code above the selected code.  And just because I can, if you are on a Mac, the extension uses text-to-speech to creepily tell you \"Your instant code review is done.\"\n</p>\n<p>So what\'s going on here?  Behind the scenes I have an IM event gateway running. You remember event gateways; we added them in ColdFusion 7. They allow you to have ColdFusion be an IM or SMS client among other things. I use that gateway to take code from the IDE and pass it along to your IM gateway.  The gateway can also listen for IMs.  When it receives the response from your friend, it uses a locally written queue file to match up the response with the file that generated the code review request.\n</p>\n<p>Don\'t take my word for it, here\'s a video demo.\n</p>\n<p>\n\n<object width=\"601\" height=\"338\">\n<param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" />\n<param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" />\n<param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=7706690&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=00ADEF&amp;fullscreen=1\" /><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"601\" height=\"338\" src=\"http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=7706690&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=00ADEF&amp;fullscreen=1\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\"></embed>\n</object>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/7706690\">ColdFusion Builder - Instant Code Review</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/user2656909\">Terry Ryan</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\n<p>Now I don\'t see this as a completely useful extension.

Okay, I know, code generation is so passé, but stick with me here I have some cool stuff for you.\n</p>\n<p>So.  Code generation.  Okay, I have a ColdFusion Builder Extension named Apptacular. It\'s an application scaffolder that builds an application from a database.  Pretty standard stuff.  But I wanted to do something cool with it.\n</p>\n<p>I started with how I handle overriding.  Every scaffolder can create a default application, but where they start to fall down is when you want to override the defaults. A good example of this is form labels.  The database field is \"first_name\" but you want the form label for that control to say \"First Name.\" Different scaffolders solve this in different ways.  I went with the tried and true XML configuration file route.  My previous experience with this type of development tells me that people NEVER edit the XML.  It\'s a pain.  Okay, fair enough, but I\'m using ColdFusion and ColdFusion Builder.  I can create interfaces that allow you to edit your configs without looking at the XML. I\'ve done that.\n</p>\n<p>This feature allows me to do all sort of tweaks to the application.  I can change label, sort order, and foreign key label fields. I can also change aspects of the application like where the CFCs are stored, how the services are created, etc. It uses XML, but you don\'t. (Unless you want to.)\n</p>\n<p>The next thing I tried to do is make the interface for the entire set of configuration tools look a little better than the default.  I used the ColdFusion Builder Extension APIs ability to display a URL as an interface to handle this. So I sprinkled in a little HTML, CSS and images to make a pleasing, branded, interface for my extension.\n</p>\n<p>Then I put a lot of work into data modeling correctly.  I can detect relationships and build the proper ColdFusion ORM CFCs for it. I can get commonly used items like number of related items.\n</p>\n<p>Finally, there are a lot of little features like virtual columns, authentication, and Flex services that I\'ve added.  I should have a few videos of this in action for you over the next week.\n</p>\n<p>The code is not quite ready to share yet, but I wanted to get it out there for all to see, and if need be, comment.      </p>','Apptacular ColdFusion Builder Extension','','publish','open','open','','apptacular-coldfusion-builder-extension','','','2009-12-11 14:35:15','2009-12-11 14:35:15','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/apptacular-coldfusion-builder-extension',0,'post','',2),(347,1,'2009-12-11 14:38:09','2009-12-11 14:38:09','<p>Scaffolding against a database has been done to death.  But I wanted to take on some of the harder challenges.  How do you act towards relationships? How do you handle one to many, many to one, and many to many relationships?  How do you detect these relationships? This is especially important with the ORM features in ColdFusion 9.  If we can detect these, and model our CFCs correctly we can save a lot of time by generating these CFCs with relationships included. Then if we scaffold on views that take these relationships into account, we can really turbo charge development.\n</p>\n<p>I also wanted to take on a few key issues like paging and performance. Basically, I wanted paging to be easy. That meant wiring it up from the get go.   I wanted performance to be usable. That meant writing common needs like column counts automatically in HQL for optimal performance.\n</p>\n<p>So that\'s some of what I\'ve set out to do in Apptacular.

This post and video will talk about making that application look more like you want.\n</p>\n<p>First off, everything has a display name.  That display name is altered in the data model tools of Apptacular or in the XML directly. Then you might want to alter what column gets used when your table shows up in another table\'s interface because of a relationship.  This is called a foreign key label.  This is also editable in the configuration.   After you get all of your labels done right, you want to order all of your columns correctly.  You guessed it; it\'s done in the configuration tools.  Finally, you might want to make up columns to use in your various labels. Apptacular has the concept of \"virtual columns\", which will allow you create custom getters for things like concatenated or formatted columns.\n</p>\n<p>Once you get past interface issues, you may want to change application structure, move code around, or fine tune choices.  This is done through the Application configuration.  You can also detect obsolete code and have it removed automatically.  Finally, if you are so inclined, Apptacular includes a login piece that can add an easy authentication form to your application.\n</p>\n<p>So still a work in progress, hopefully this creates a good starting place for applications.  My next post will talk about integrating this back-end into a Flex front-end. </p>\n<p>\n\n<object width=\"601\" height=\"338\">\n<param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" />\n<param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" />\n<param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=8175252&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=00ADEF&amp;fullscreen=1\" /><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"601\" height=\"338\" src=\"http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=8175252&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=00ADEF&amp;fullscreen=1\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed>\n</object>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/8175252\">Apptacular ColdFusion Builder Extension - Aesthetics</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/user2656909\">Terry Ryan</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>','Apptacular ColdFusion Builder Extension - Aesthetics','','publish','open','open','','apptacular-coldfusion-builder-extension-aesthetics','','','2009-12-14 13:10:47','2009-12-14 13:10:47','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/apptacular-coldfusion-builder-extension-aesthetics',0,'post','',2),(349,1,'2009-12-16 19:02:59','2009-12-16 19:02:59','<p>For my next Extension trick, I want to show how to use Apptacular to jump start your Flex development.

I\'ve had these thoughts thundering around upstairs and needed to get rid of them.\n</p>\n<p>I really like Apple and their products.  The MacBook Pro saved me from Vista, and I haven\'t looked back. The iPhone is a great piece of technology.  I would really want an iPad if I didn\'t have a Kindle already. I have to say I\'m really disappointed by all of this Flash and Apple nonsense.  I\'m also happy to read that some other people are disappointed by this (<a href=\"http://i.gizmodo.com/5458382/8-things-that-suck-about-the-ipad\">Gizmodo</a>, <a href=\"http://digital.venturebeat.com/2010/01/27/no-flash-apple-ipad/\">Digital Beat</a>, <a href=\"http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=855356\">MacRumors Forum</a>, <a href=\"http://fucktheipad.com/\">FucktheIpad</a>).\n</p>\n<p>Some of Apple\'s justification for the lack of Flash, namely performance issues, seems to fall a little flat here.  Supposedly by designing the chip themselves, Apple has a chip that can render webpages instantly and still play video for 10 hours.  It would appear that performance isn\'t really the issue with the iPad.\n</p>\n<p>That being said I have never really understood the whole Flash-performs-poorly-on-Mac thing.  I work for Adobe.  I am a member of the Flash Platform evangelism team. I use multiple Flash applications, every day of my life, for hours on end. I don\'t have browser crashing issues.  I currently use Chrome, and used Firefox before that.  I never really gelled with Safari.  I\'m not being obtuse here, or acting, I just don\'t have those particular problems. I\'m not running a special version of Flash Player either; I just use the latest released version.\n</p>\n<p>I also don\'t understand cognitive gymnastics it takes to hate Flash because it\'s proprietary and love the fact that Apple is batting us around by designing systems that block it by way of preventing one from installing it through a proprietary gatekeeper.\n</p>\n<p>Flash is proprietary.  It\'s also free, widely distributed, rapidly brought up to date on user\'s computers, and cross platform.  Yes, to some degree you have to depend on Adobe.  This is true.  Even worse, we get something out of it--we sell authoring tools, content creation tools, services, and servers that target that dependency.\n</p>\n<p>With HTML 5 you don\'t have to depend on anyone….\n</p>\n<p>Except browser authors: Opera, Mozilla, Google, Microsoft, and Apple.  But they all conform to the HTML 5 standard…\n</p>\n<p>Okay, they don\'t yet but they all have detailed plans that outline when they will support HTML 5…\n</p>\n<p>No they don\'t.   But they don\'t get anything out of it…\n</p>\n<p>Except access to your data, or locking you into their operating system, or locking you into their operating system and hardware or whatever ideologically pure motivation Mozilla and Opera have these days.\n</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, all of these technologies are driven by mutual self-interest and not by ideology.

I think this has a few advantages:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Allows  interface options enabled by the XML options\n</li>\n<li>Allows better branded extensions via CSS and background images\n</li>\n<li>Allows you to develop/debug your extensions like normal web applications\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is pretty easy to enable.  Normally you would have code like this in your handler to communicate back to the IDE:</p>\n<pre>&lt;cfheader name=\"Content-Type\" value=\"text/xml\"&gt;<br />&lt;response status=\"success\" showresponse=\"true\"&gt;<br />    &lt;ide &gt;<br />        &lt;dialog width=\"600\" height=\"400\" /&gt;<br />        &lt;body&gt;<br />            &lt;![CDATA[<br />                Some Response<br />            ]]&gt;<br />        &lt;/body&gt;<br />    &lt;/ide&gt;<br />&lt;/response&gt;</pre>\n<p>Instead you pass a URL parameter to the ide tag in your extension handler:</p>\n<pre>&lt;cfheader name=\"Content-Type\" value=\"text/xml\"&gt;<br />&lt;cfoutput&gt; <br />&lt;response showresponse=\"true\"&gt; <br />    &lt;ide url=\"http://localhost/extension/handler.cfm?configPath=#configPath#\" &gt; <br />        &lt;dialog width=\"655\" height=\"600\" /&gt; <br />    &lt;/ide&gt; <br />&lt;/response&gt; <br />&lt;/cfoutput&gt;</pre>\n<p>As you can see it can even handle URL variables.\n</p>\n<p>Now, where I ran into trouble with this was with the URL itself. Basically you can\'t be sure of the URL when dealing with extensions.  It could be localhost, but it just as easily could be on a remote server.   So I was all clever and wrote some code to handle this:</p>\n<pre>&lt;cfset baseURL = \"http://\" &amp; cgi.server_name  /&gt;<br />&lt;cfset messagesPath = getDirectoryFromPath(cgi.script_name) &amp; \"/messages.cfm\" /&gt;<br />&lt;cfset messagesOptions = \"?type=notanapplication\" /&gt;<br />&lt;cfset messagesURL = baseURL  &amp; messagesPath &amp; messagesOptions &gt;</pre>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You see, this will give me the correct URL to use to pass information to a template named \"messages.cfm\" that sits in the same folder as my handler.  I use CGI variables to grab the server information.  Then I use getDirectoryFromPath to make sure that I get the real relative path of the folder that the extension is sitting in (as opposed to assuming that it lives in the webroot).  This works great.\n</p>\n<p>Except I got reports of one of my extensions not working at all for some people.  Look at that code again… There\'s another big assumption there.  The assumption is that the extension is being called over the default http port, which for many ColdFusion developers it isn\'t.  So the correct version of this code goes:</p>\n<pre>&lt;cfset baseURL = \"http://\" &amp; cgi.server_name &amp; \":\" &amp; cgi.server_port /&gt;<br />&lt;cfset messagesPath = getDirectoryFromPath(cgi.script_name) &amp; \"/messages.cfm\" /&gt;<br />&lt;cfset messagesOptions = \"?type=notanapplication\" /&gt;<br />&lt;cfset messagesURL = baseURL  &amp; messagesPath &amp; messagesOptions &gt;</pre>\n<p>Doing this you can be sure that you hit the right URL regardless of:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Server hostname\n</li>\n<li>Server http port\n</li>\n<li>Relative location of extension to the webroot\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> Happy extension building.\n</p>','Builder Extension using HTML','','publish','open','open','','builder-extension-using-html','','','2010-02-03 18:05:15','2010-02-03 18:05:15','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/builder-extension-using-html',0,'post','',1),(360,1,'2010-02-21 22:51:27','2010-02-21 22:51:27','<p>Evidently we rolled out the first cumulative hotfix for ColdFusion 9 on Friday.

Consequently the SWF could call the Mac hosted WSDL but not the Windows hosts WSDL.  My solution?  Create a static WSDL file that had the service spelled both ways.  Maybe a hack but worked like charm.\n</p>\n<p>Anyway, if you want to see the code, it\'s available on github:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://github.com/tpryan/BuilderStats\">ColdFusion Builder Extension</a>\n		</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://github.com/tpryan/BuilderStatsFlex\">Flex Front End</a>\n		</li>\n</ul>\n<p>*WSDL? Why not Flash Remoting (or ColdFusion in the Data/Services list)? Remoting needs to be configured to each system\'s configuration, and isn\'t very discoverable.  WSDL doesn\'t require knowing about the Extension user\'s AMF setup; it just uses a URL, which can be easily discovered.\n</p>\n<p> </p>','ColdFusion Builder Extension Using Flex','','publish','open','open','','coldfusion-builder-extension-using-flex','','','2010-03-05 16:29:03','2010-03-05 16:29:03','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/coldfusion-builder-extension-using-flex',0,'post','',1),(365,1,'2010-03-05 16:55:42','2010-03-05 16:55:42','<p>For some reason, the ColdFusion Team is going on a tour in March and April, to spread the word about ColdFusion Builder, which is currently in <a href=\"http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/coldfusionbuilder/\">public beta 3 on labs.adobe.com</a>.\n</p>\n<p>I\'m hitting two cities for now; some other dates are still in talks:\n</p>\n<p>Dallas<br />March 24, 2010 7:30PM - 10:00PM <br /><a href=\"http://groups.adobe.com/posts/a1d79161c4\">To RSVP</a>\n	</p>\n<p>Philadelphia<br />March 30, 2010 6:00PM - 7:00PM<br /><a href=\"http://phillycfugmar2010.eventbrite.com/\">To RSVP</a>\n	</p>\n<p>I\'m extremely excited about both of these events.

With few exceptions every release was a phenomenal leap over the previous versions.\n</p>\n<p>Of course I\'m going to say this, because I work for Adobe, right? Well I\'ve griped, but gripes go inward, not outwards. (At least in the written form ;) )\n</p>\n<p>It\'s not hard for me to pick my favorite feature: ColdFusion Builder Extensions. Extending an IDE isn\'t a new concept. We chose Eclipse as the platform for ColdFusion Builder precisely because it was designed to be extended. But the fact that ColdFusion developers can extend Builder with the language in which they are expert instead of dropping down to Java and Eclipse development is huge. It makes the development of plugins have almost no barriers to entry. Have an idea? Write 50 lines of code and XML and there it is. We\'ve already seen 30 extensions up on <a href=\"http://www.riaforge.org/\">RIAForge</a> before ColdFusion Builder is even out of beta.  I am continuously impressed at what the community is doing in this space, and I can\'t wait to see what they do after today.\n</p>\n<p>Check out for yourself what the community has done at the <a href=\"http://www.riaforge.org/index.cfm?event=page.category&amp;id=14\">ColdFusion Builder Extensions section at RIAForge</a>.\n</p>\n<p>It\'s tough to get a sense of how good a product is when you are working this close to it. You don\'t know if you have something, or you\'re suffering from groupthink. But some people will always find fault, some people will always love everything. You have to throw away those opinions and focus on the rest.  Doing this, I think the verdict on ColdFusion Builder is that it is a great product, an impressive 1.0 product, and it still has lots of potential for which to strive in future versions.\n</p>\n<p>I think the engineers, and product manager (<a href=\"http://adrocknaphobia.com/\">Adam Lehman)</a> deserve a round of applause (and several rounds of whatever they want to drink) for their efforts.\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://bit.ly/GetBolt\">Go get yourself some ColdFusion Builder today!</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>* Or possibly earlier.</p>','ColdFusion Builder GO!','','publish','open','open','','coldfusion-builder-go','','','2010-03-21 23:19:42','2010-03-21 23:19:42','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/coldfusion-builder-go',0,'post','',7),(370,1,'2010-03-22 10:22:11','2010-03-22 10:22:11','<p><img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"/blog/assets/content//fl_builder_4_prem_bxshot_3in_no_shadow_png.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"389\" height=\"555\" />Asked a few times in various places:\n</p>\n<p><em>If I am a Flex Builder 3 Professional User, is there a way to upgrade and still get ColdFusion Builder, since ColdFusion Builder comes with a copy of Flash Builder?\n</em></p>\n<p>If you are a Flex Builder 3 Professional User, you can upgrade to Flash Builder Premium for $299.

At the end of the New Project Wizard you can choose from a list of all of the extensions that have this enabled, and run anything an extension can do.  This is really cool for starting up your projects with your preferred structure and style right from the get go.  The video demo shows running Apptacular in this manner.\n</p>\n<p><strong>Prefixes\n</strong></p>\n<p>ORM and databases are great together, but sometimes database conventions run afoul of ORM best practices.  Take table prefixes for example.  Having a table with tbl_user makes some sense on the database side, it\'s basically Hungarian notation for tables. (I\'ve also seen people append the schema name to the table, as in the video.)\n</p>\n<p>As necessary as it may be on the database side, it\'s a big pain on the ORM side.  We don\'t want to work with a <em>tbl_user object</em>, we want to work with a <em>user</em> object.\n</p>\n<p>Apptacular allows you to set a prefix that you can have removed from any of your tables.  In this case it will convert the table <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">tbl_user</span> to the ORM entity <em>user</em>.  Very handy, and saves a lot of work.\n</p>\n<p><strong>Plurals\n</strong></p>\n<p>The other convention that gets in the way of generating ORM content from the database is plurals in tables.  So table <em>users</em> should translate to the ORM entity <em>user</em>. I\'ve added a checkmark option that will try and do that for you.\n</p>\n<p>So these options combine to make writing clean, readable ORM from databases with these conventions really quick and easy.  Check out the video to see this in action.  </p>\n<p>\n\n<object width=\"601\" height=\"376\">\n<param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" />\n<param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" />\n<param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=10526198&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=00ADEF&amp;fullscreen=1\" /><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"601\" height=\"376\" src=\"http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=10526198&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=00ADEF&amp;fullscreen=1\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\"></embed>\n</object>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/10526198\">Apptacular ColdFusion Builder Extension - onProjectCreate, prefixes and depluralizing.</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/user2656909\">Terry Ryan</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>','Apptacular, onProjectCreate, and Annoying Database Conventions','','publish','open','open','','apptacular-onprojectcreate-and-annoying-database-conventions','','','2010-03-29 13:10:34','2010-03-29 13:10:34','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/apptacular-onprojectcreate-and-annoying-database-conventions',0,'post','',1),(378,1,'2010-04-05 10:25:27','2010-04-05 10:25:27','<p>This week I\'m doing two stops on the ColdFusion Builder User Group tour.

I wanted to write a book about my experiences trying to get coworkers to adopt new tools and techniques.  Much to my pleasure and surprise, they accepted my proposal, and I\'ve been working on it ever since.\n</p>\n<p>My goal was to write a book to help people who were struggling to get new tools and technologies adopted at their workplace.  I wanted to share tools and techniques for promoting change.  Or to put it more eloquently by the publisher:\n</p>\n<p><em>Your co-workers\' resistance to new technologies can be baffling. Logical arguments can fail. If you don\'t do politics, you will fail. With Driving Technical Change, by Terrence Ryan, you\'ll learn to read users\' \"patterns of resistance -and then dismantle their objections. Every developer must master the art of evangelizing. With these techniques and strategies, you\'ll help your organization adopt your solutions-without selling your soul to organizational politics.\n</em></p>\n<p>As of April 7th the book is now available in Beta format.  Part of the deal when your publishers are programmers is that books can go through beta.  So you can buy it now, in a package deal with the eventual paperback.  <a href=\"http://pragprog.com/titles/trevan/driving-technical-change\">Feel free to go buy it</a>… Wait what a horrible salesman I am.  <a href=\"http://pragprog.com/titles/trevan/driving-technical-change\">BUY MY BOOK</a>!\n</p>\n<p>If the topic sounds familiar, it is.  I gave a talk a few years back at cf.Objective 2008 called <a href=\"/blog/post.cfm/selling_professional_development_techniques\">Selling Professional Development at the Hostile Shop</a>. This book is certainly a descendant of that talk.  But I have to say I\'ve learned a lot more since then:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The people who aren\'t adopting what you want are not your enemies\n</li>\n<li>In most cases, you yourself are responsible for your difficulties in getting people onboard\n</li>\n<li>But this means in most cases you have success within your reach\n</li>\n<li>Trust is the most important commodity you have in your efforts</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I tried to bring that wisdom into the book version.  Titling the book was pretty hard, so we called in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat_Loaf\">Meat Loaf</a> as a consultant, and he arrived at the monster title - <a href=\"http://pragprog.com/titles/trevan/driving-technical-change\">Driving Technical Change: Why People On Your Team Don\'t Act On Good Ideas, and How to Convince Them They Should</a>. (His original pass was <em>My Co-workers Will Do Anything at Work but They Won\'t Do That</em>.)

In response over <strong>20,0000</strong> of you have signed up and are ready to learn more.\n</p>\n<p>I\'m personally doing two sessions:\n</p>\n<p><strong>Adobe Flash Builder 4 and Adobe ColdFusion 9\n</strong></p>\n<p><em>May 12, 2010 2 pm PDT\n</em></p>\n<p>Flash Builder 4 and ColdFusion 9 were made to work with each other, literally. This session will show you the features in ColdFusion 9 that will make your Flex life easier. You will also get to see how Flash Builder\'s new features help to rapidly make Flash-powered front ends for your ColdFusion back ends.\n</p>\n<p><strong>Adobe ColdFusion 9 and Adobe Flash Catalyst CS5\n</strong></p>\n<p><em>May 14, 2010 11 am PDT\n</em></p>\n<p>ColdFusion has always been about RAD. It continues to be the fastest way to create back-ends for your data-driven applications. Flash Catalyst can do the same for your front ends, making it easy to create Flash-powered content that people want to use. This session will show you how Flash Catalyst and ColdFusion can be combined for some lightning-fast application development.\n</p>\n<p>So go sign up and be a part of what is shaping up to be quite a massive event.\n</p>\n<p>Make sure you check out the rest of the content:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Welcome and Introduction to the Adobe® Flash® Platform: Ben Forta\n</li>\n<li>Building Multi-Screen Applications with the Adobe® Flash® Platform and Adobe® Creative Suite® 5: Paul Trani\n</li>\n<li>New Features in Adobe® Flex® 4 Framework: Deepa Subramaniam\n</li>\n<li>New Features in Adobe® Flash® Builder™ 4: Andrew Shorten\n</li>\n<li>Adobe® Flash® Catalyst™ CS5 for Developers: Doug Winnie\n</li>\n<li>Building Mobile Applications with Adobe® Flash® Professional™ CS5: Create a Game: Paul Trani\n</li>\n<li>What\'s New in Adobe® Flash® Builder™ for Java Developers: James Ward\n</li>\n<li>New Features in Adobe® Flash® Player 10.1: Lee Brimelow\n</li>\n<li>Creating Sexy Applications with the Adobe® Flash® Platform: Designer-Developer Workflow: Serge Jespers\n</li>\n<li>A Basic CRUD Application with Zend AMF and Adobe® Flex 4 Ryan Stewart and Kevin Schroeder\n</li>\n<li>Adobe® Flash® Builder™ 4 and Adobe® ColdFusion® 9: Terry Ryan\n</li>\n<li>Advanced Features In Adobe® Flex®: Ely Greenfield\n</li>\n<li>AS34J: ActionScript 3 for Java Developers: Chet Haase\n</li>\n<li>Adobe® Flash® Platform and Salesforce.com: James Ward\n</li>\n<li>Adobe® Flash® Builder™ for Adobe® Dreamweaver® CS5 Users: Ryan Stewart\n</li>\n<li>Using Advanced Features with Adobe® Flex® &amp; PHP: Ryan Stewart\n</li>\n<li>Adobe® ColdFusion® 9 and Adobe® Flash® Catalyst™ CS5: Terry Ryan\n</li>\n<li>Adobe® Flex® and BlazeDS Integration with SpringSource: Christophe Coenraets and Jeremy Grelle\n</li>\n<li>Building Desktop Applications with Adobe® AIR® 2.0: Ryan Stewart</li>\n</ul>','Come be Part of Adobe Developer Week','','publish','open','open','','come-be-part-of-adobe-developer-week','','','2010-05-04 16:31:49','2010-05-04 16:31:49','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/come-be-part-of-adobe-developer-week',0,'post','',0),(382,1,'2010-05-14 17:04:32','2010-05-14 17:04:32','<p>After <a href=\"http://www.scotch-on-the-rocks.co.uk/\">Scotch on the Rocks</a>, <a href=\"http://coldfusionjedi.com/\">Ray Camden</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bennadel.com/\">Ben Nadel</a>, <a href=\"http://www.englebert.be/blog/\">Claude Englebert</a> , Alison Huselid and myself are going to tour around Europe, spreading the ColdFusion goodness to the continent.

Your day going okay?  Cool.  I\'m not looking to fight you. It got a little heated on Twitter.  I know our community is passionate; sometimes that \"<em>passion</em>\" becomes \"<em>an angry mob of flame warriors.</em>\"\n</p>\n<p>You think bad things about ColdFusion.  You\'re certainly entitled to your opinions, but I think you\'re mistaken.  I think it\'s possible you haven\'t tried ColdFusion in the past few years, or ever. If you haven\'t, <a href=\"http://adobe.com/go/coldfusion\">I invite you do so</a>.\n</p>\n<p>But let\'s be civil. We can disagree without it being a whole flame war thing.\n</p>\n<p>Let me respond to your issues, we\'ll see if I can\'t persuade you to see things from a different view.  First, let\'s start with why you say you dislike ColdFusion:\n</p>\n<p><strong>\"ColdFusion encourages spaghetti code.\"</strong></p>\n<p>It doesn\'t.  Unfortunately, it enables it, just like most other languages. However, we do have a number of features and community driven projects around enabling well-architected applications. Those include:\n</p>\n<ul style=\"margin-left: 38pt\">\n<li><a href=\"http://help.adobe.com/en_US/ColdFusion/9.0/Developing/WSc3ff6d0ea77859461172e0811cbec22c24-7ffb.html\">Custom Tags</a> or encapsulated views.\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://help.adobe.com/en_US/ColdFusion/9.0/Developing/WSc3ff6d0ea77859461172e0811cbec22c24-7fec.html\">CFC</a>s, which are analogous but not equivalent to classes in Java.\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://help.adobe.com/en_US/ColdFusion/9.0/Developing/WSc3ff6d0ea77859461172e0811cbec22c24-78b7.html\">Easily Created SOAP based web services.</a>\n		</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;q=site:riaforge.org+REST&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=f&amp;oq=&amp;gs_rfai=\">Various community REST based web service projects</a>.\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.carehart.org/cf411/\">Various frameworks.</a>\n		</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of these combine to make it easy to create well-encapsulated, modern projects in ColdFusion. Here\'s <a href=\"http://github.com/tpryan/GoogleTranslationAPICFC/blob/master/cfc/translator.cfc\">an example of some modern ColdFusion code</a> I used in a recent project.\n</p>\n<p><strong>\"ColdFusion is just tags.\"\n</strong></p>\n<p>Actually it isn\'t. In addition to CFML, ColdFusion also supports CFScript.  Most of the core features that CFML enables are available here.  There are a few view related features (for example AJAX driven html form tags) that aren\'t implemented in CFScript because they don\'t make sense to.\n</p>\n<p>One thing I\'ve found about writing in both script and markup is that writing an app entirely in markup is painful and silly, as much as writing entirely in script is. I\'ve come around to the idea that views should be in markup. Views contain hierarchies of content, containers, and other features that are easy to express and understand in markup.  On the other hand, when you are dealing with large libraries of functions and business logic while trying to figure out what each piece of code does the less extraneous characters the better. That\'s why scripting is better on back-end code.\n</p>\n<p>ColdFusion enables both. Do what you like, where you like. You have the choice in CF to do so.\n</p>\n<p><strong>\"ColdFusion isn\'t free.\"\n</strong></p>\n<p>It isn\'t. Sure there are open source clones out there, and if you like the rest of what I have to say, but can\'t get over this, feel free to check them out.\n</p>\n<p>ColdFusion is a productive language. If you look at Total Cost of Ownership versus similar products, you\'ll see that the cost of licensing is a small part. Development and maintenance is the largest chunk of TCO. Every solution pays this cost, and a language that is more productive will be cheaper in the long run, despite upfront licensing costs.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blog/assets/content//toc.png\" alt=\"Total Cost of Overship Chart\" width=\"630\" height=\"186\" /></p>\n<p>All that being said, I skipped out on one part of the story here: development is free.  The developer version of ColdFusion is free. If you do move to a production environment, shared development, testing, and disaster recovery servers are free too. The IDE, ColdFusion Builder, isn\'t free, but there are free and open source alternatives.  If you are using ColdFusion for educational purposes the server and IDE are both free.\n</p>\n<p>ColdFusion does have low cost hosting out there.  Additionally, ColdFusion 9 tweaked the EULA with regards to cloud hosting, making it both possible, and economical.\n</p>\n<p>It\'s not free. It costs money.  But we at Adobe feel that we provide a lot of value for that cost.\n</p>\n<p><strong>\"ColdFusion doesn\'t have any open source projects.\"</strong></p>\n<p>Riaforge.org, which requires included projects to be open source, lists <a href=\"http://www.riaforge.org/index.cfm?event=page.category&amp;id=1\">716 ColdFusion projects</a> and <a href=\"http://www.riaforge.org/index.cfm?event=page.category&amp;id=14\">39 ColdFusion Builder Extensions</a> at the time of this post. Brian Rinaldi\'s open source list lists <a href=\"http://www.remotesynthesis.com/cfopensourcelist/\">352 projects</a>.\n</p>\n<p>Enough with your arguments let me tell you <strong>why I think ColdFusion rocks</strong>:\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/post.cfm/coldfusions-advantage\">I\'ve already written extensively on this</a>, so I\'ll sum up and invite you to check out some of these other posts.\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/post.cfm/coldfusion-makes-hard-things-very-easy\"><strong>ColdFusion makes hard things easy</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Most things in ColdFusion are single operations. By \"most things\", I mean \"things that every web programmer has to do but other technology solutions don\'t integrate at a language level.\"  Send an email? Wrap 2 lines of code around your message content. Talk to an LDAP server? One ColdFusion tag call (or script object.)  I don\'t have to manage database connections. <a href=\"/blog/post.cfm/queries-are-the-secret-sauce-of-coldfusion\">ColdFusion has features that make it easy to work with results from a database</a>. <a href=\"/blog/post.cfm/cfhttp-equivalent-in-java-really-java-really\"> It doesn\'t take me 80 lines of code to talk do an HTTP get request</a>.\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/post.cfm/coldfusion-plays-well-with-others\"><strong>ColdFusion already integrates with lots of technology</strong></a>. Need to talk to LDAP, Microsoft Exchange, Microsoft Office or a Java Portlet server? ColdFusion comes equipped to do so.  Need to integrate some Java or .NET project into your application?  ColdFusion can talk to either. Need to talk to printers or cell phones via SMS? ColdFusion can do it.  The great thing here is that I don\'t have to search for and rely on third-party code to do so. I can if I want to but for a lot of these commonly used technologies, ColdFusion already talks to them.\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/post.cfm/coldfusion-has-many-roles-to-play\"><strong>ColdFusion can play many roles in a web application stack</strong></a>.  Need to build a classic HTML driven web application, or and AJAX driven site?  ColdFusion can handle that. Want to build a Flash based rich application?  ColdFusion has special protocols that make it a snap to call from Flash, again right out of the box. Need to write a SOAP or REST  API for your application?  ColdFusion can do that, usually by just writing an easy façade on your existing code. Need to build an IM or SMS driven application without a web based front end… Yep, ColdFusion has you covered.\n</p>\n<p>I hope you made it this far. I hope I caused you to question your stance.

That means that people who aren\'t long-standing members of the ColdFusion community can break in and get a chance to speak despite not being a \"name.\"\n</p>\n<p>I see CFUnited\'s end as an opportunity for Adobe and the ColdFusion community to invest in more of these local specialized and regional events.  We now have more resources collectively to do that together.\n</p>\n<p>So I issue a challenge to everyone lamenting CFUnited\'s demise.

Here what I had to say about FUD:\n</p>\n<p><em>FUD stands for \"fear, uncertainty and doubt.\" Though the phrase was coined in the mid 1970\'s, the concept has been around since the first caveman traded a rock to another one \"in case the mastodons come back.\" More recently it\'s been marketers, public relations flacks, and sales guys who use this on you. Basically, the idea is to tell you something that will make you afraid of a rival\'s tool, enough so that you invest with the FUD\'er.\n</em></p>\n<p><em>At a smaller level, this happens in the workplace a lot. Developers with experience with proprietary tools spread rumors about crazy license implications of open source tools. Open source adherents spread horror stories of hidden code in proprietary tool kits.\n</em></p>\n<p><em>It\'s ultimately self-defeating. At best it can win people some sort of short term gains, but in the long term, it is a road to nowhere. Eventually people wise up to be bullied repeatedly and some people speak out. This spread of information inoculates the rest and the technique becomes ineffective. </em>[from chapter \"<a href=\"http://media.pragprog.com/titles/trevan/trust.pdf\">Create Trust</a>\"]\n</p>\n<p>I stand by that.

I can say categorically that people do use ColdFusion.\n</p>\n<p>But what are the hard numbers that we can quantify?  From our sales, community and web teams I can grab the following numbers:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>12,000+ companies are customers of ColdFusion\n</li>\n<li>350+ ColdFusion user groups are in existence\n</li>\n<li>11,000+ copies of ColdFusion Server and ColdFusion Builder are downloaded every month.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Number of developers is a trickier issue. There is no direct way of tracking this.  We can look at sales, but there isn\'t a typical ratio of server to developer.  So we have to rely on estimates. We have recently had some conflicting data here. Third-party numbers that we have access to say one thing; our internal estimates based on older models say another thing. Both agree that we\'ve gained developers, but the numbers are too far apart to be useful.  We are in the processes of doing a <a href=\"http://www.adrocknaphobia.com/post.cfm/coldfusion-developer-population-survey\">ColdFusion developer census</a> using a new method, so if you are a <a href=\"http://bit.ly/CFDevPop\">ColdFusion developer please participate</a>.\n</p>\n<p>Numbers are great, but let me introduce you to the community of ColdFusion developers.\n</p>\n<p>First, you probably met some when you dissed ColdFusion on Twitter. As you discovered the <a href=\"http://search.twitter.com/search?q=coldfusion\">ColdFusion twitters</a> are passionate, but you may not have seen how helpful they are. Ask a real question about ColdFusion on twitter something like:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do #ColdFusion Excel features let you work with xls files only, or does it handle xlsx?\n</li>\n<li>Does outer joining work for objects work in HQL in #ColdFusion?\n</li>\n<li>What\'s the CFscript equivalent of cfquery tag in #ColdFusion 9?\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I assure you, you\'ll get the best responses 140 characters can buy.\n</p>\n<p>Also check out the community on <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/coldfusion\">StackOverflow</a>.  We also have one at <a href=\"http://www.dzone.com/links/search.html?query=coldfusion&amp;x=0&amp;y=0\">Dzone</a>.  And at <a href=\"http://github.com/languages/ColdFusion\">github</a>. We\'ve got a small but growing presence in all of them.\n</p>\n<p>Now, you might notice that participation is constant, but not a tremendous amount.  That\'s because the ColdFusion Community tends to be a bit insular.   As a whole the community is working on it, but when you look at ColdFusion only resources like <a href=\"http://www.houseoffusion.com/groups/cf-talk/\">CFTalk</a> and <a href=\"http://www.coldfusionbloggers.org/stats.cfm\">ColdFusionBloggers.org</a> you\'ll see constant volume.\n</p>\n<p>Finally, if you look at the number of open source projects available at <a href=\"http://www.riaforge.org/\">Riaforge.org</a>, you\'ll see again that there are definitely OS collaboration around ColdFusion.\n</p>\n<p>Finally check out the list of <a href=\"http://www.carehart.org/cf411/\">ColdFusion conferences</a>.  A third of them are new conferences and have popped up over the past 3 years. We\'re seeing a shift from huge national conferences to smaller regional conferences in the US, as well as a few more international events and activities mostly in Europe.\n</p>\n<p>All of these point to a vibrant community that is engaged and loves using ColdFusion. Are we the biggest community? No, and no one will dispute that.  But we are a community; we\'re evidently still growing in numbers, and still branching out into new social networks. We use ColdFusion, and we love it.\n</p>\n<p>To sum up this long answer to your short question: <em>Do people still use ColdFusion?</em>\n		<strong>Hell yeah</strong>.\n</p>\n<p>Now, you might be changing your argument, from \"no one uses it\" to \"well it\'s not good because…\" Well if that\'s the case, <a href=\"/blog/post.cfm/dear-coldfusion-skeptic\">I have another blog post</a> for you to read.\n</p>','Dear ColdFusion Denier','','publish','open','open','','dear-coldfusion-denier','','','2010-07-02 10:25:42','2010-07-02 10:25:42','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/dear-coldfusion-denier',0,'post','',4),(392,1,'2010-07-02 10:35:17','2010-07-02 10:35:17','<p>I\'m starting up new little series entitled \"Holy Crap, I\'m a Mobile Developer.\" The idea is that somewhere along the way I developed the ability to build applications for mobile devices, specifically Android.  Sadly I can\'t take any credit for this. The Flash Platform engineering teams did this to me.\n</p>\n<p>In my series of demos, I\'m going to show how to take a static Fireworks composition and turn it into an application running on a Nexus One.   I start out using Flash Catalyst to turn the static composition into an interactive one (interactive composition sounds better than \"dumb prototype\"). After Catalyst, I add business logic using Flash Builder.  Finally I use the AIR 2.5 SDK and the Android SDK to convert it to an Android app and drop it onto my phone.\n</p>\n<p>My point here with these posts is to show off just how frickin\' easy it is to get your stuff onto a mobile device with the Flash Platform.  It\'s so easy that I can do it.  That\'s not false modesty, I\'m mostly a back-end ColdFusion expert; on the front-end though, I\'m usually at a loss. Not with these tools, I\'m not.  These tools make me look like a front-end genius.

I was trying to add that whole dynamic/static inheritance thing to <a href=\"http://bit.ly/Apptacular\">Apptacular</a> so you can add on to an Apptacular application without having to worry about changes being overridden by the regeneration process. Typically when you do that, the dynamic, rewritten class is usually the parent of the child static class. The child, static, class is what you refer to in the rest of code and in which you write custom code. The scaffolder never touches this file again, allowing you to alter things in the database, rescaffold and not overwrite code customizations.  I hearby call this \"non-destructive scaffold regeneration,\" regardless of what other people call it.\n</p>\n<p>ORM entities can\'t really work that way. If you try to setup that sort of thing, ORM craps out in ColdFusion with an error.  CF9 ORM doesn\'t really like ORM objects being the parent of other items, unless you are using inheritance mapping.\n</p>\n<p>However, if you use the <a href=\"http://www.silverwareconsulting.com/index.cfm/2010/7/13/ColdFusion-901-Now-Available--With-ORM-Goodies\">\"mappedSuperClass\" cfc attribute</a> that is now available in ColdFusion 9.0.1 you can achieve sort of the same thing, but you have to flip this on its head. The superclass is the one that is static, and you can edit, while the dynamic one is the child.\n</p>\n<p>This is mostly good. Except for one thing: one of the main reasons to write code this way is so you can override methods, and if the child is the one that is dynamic, and overwritten, then you cannot override the methods from the static parent. You can add methods and properties, but you cannot override them.\n</p>\n<p>At first glance this seems like a deal breaker, but it doesn\'t have to be.  Most <em>generated</em> ORM entities are light on code, because of implicit getters and setters.  But those implicit getters and setters are exactly what you want to override in an ORM entity.  However it turns out that <strong>explicit functions will always override implicit ones, even when the explicit function is in the super class and not the child class</strong>.\n</p>\n<p>I put together a simple little demo to show this off:\n</p>\n<p>\n<script src=\"http://gist.github.com/509846.js\"></script>\n</p>\n<p>Result from test.cfm:\n</p>\n<p>GetFirstName = Yo\n</p>\n<p>GetRealFirstName = Aiden\n</p>\n<p>So it\'s a little upside down, but if you want to do some non-destructive scaffold regeneration with ColdFusion 9 ORM, it\'s a workable solution.

I had a few goals:</p>\n<ul style=\"clear: both\">\n<li>Fool around with new semantic HTML 5 elements</li>\n<li>Use web fonts for typography</li>\n<li>Do some jQuery for interactivity</li>\n<li>Do a proper mobile version</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"clear: both\"><strong>Semantic HTML5</strong><br />It seems like such a geeky little thing, writing <em>header</em> instead of div id=\"header\", but I was shocked at the improvement it made. Much fewer divs made the HTML code so much easier to read, and so much easier to detect an improperly closed div.</p>\n<div id=\"header\">\n<div id=\"header\">\n<p style=\"clear: both\">The danger here is that much like the \"Tables are evil, use css instead of tables in all cases\" stupidity that happened in the shift from tables to css, there will be a cry of \"divs are evil, use semantic tags\" in the ramp up to HTML5 sites. I really wish we could trick the irrationally passionate to scream \"Not using the correct element for the correct job is evil, use the correct element for the correct job.\" But I guess that doesn\'t flow as well.</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">The one issue I ran into was the utter failure of all versions of IE with HMTL 5. I couldn\'t get CSS styles for any of my header, footer, etc. tags to render. IE only accounts for 20% of my readership - enough that I can\'t ignore, but not enough to build a separate site for. Luckily there is a technique called the <a href=\"http://ejohn.org/blog/html5-shiv/\">HTML5 Shiv</a> that gets it to work. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\"><strong>Web Fonts</strong><br />Web fonts are simply awesome. After 15 years of working with the web, it\'s a revelation to have a wider range of font selection at the ready. (I\'m aware of both font stacks and SIFR, but this kicks both of their asses.)</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">Being an Adobean, I wanted to use an Adobe font for the site. <a href=\"http://typekit.com/fonts\">Typekit</a> is our exclusive partner for Adobe fonts on the web. It was awesomely easy to set up and get working. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">The one problem I ran into occurred on Firefox. Every other browser rendered the fonts beautifully; on Firefox, plain san serif fonts flashed on the screen for a second. Firefox makes up close to half of my traffic, so I had to get that fixed. <a href=\"http://blog.typekit.com/2010/10/29/font-events-controlling-the-fout/\">This is a known issue with Typekit and Firefox, and there is a solution</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\"><strong>jQuery and Mobile design</strong><br />Other things came up that forced me to speed up the schedule for getting this done. I skipped a lot of interactivity, because quite frankly, it\'s a personal site with a blog, not an interactive app. They would have been nice, but not necessary. I\'ll be revisiting this as I get time to do things. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">I checked the site on a few of my mobile devices. While not optimized for mobile, it works pretty well, so it\'s good enough for now. I really need to do this, but let\'s face it, no one is desperately reading my site to find out something on the run. My stats just don\'t bear that out - today. But I will address this soon. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\"><strong>BrowserLab</strong><br />It took me a week to design, markup, test, and implement the new site. (Not working on it full time.) I could never have turned it around so fast without <a href=\"https://browserlab.adobe.com\">BrowserLab</a>. BrowserLab allows you to test the site on multiple OSes and browsers in one interface. You can compare multiples in one shot, and even overlay the sites to detect differences. It made extremely short work of cross browser testing and integration. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">You get free access to BrowserLab by registering any CS5 application. If you have CS5, do it; it frickin\' rocks.</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\"><strong>Conclusions</strong><br />It\'s been about two years since I altered my site. In that time it\'s shocking how much has changed, <br />and how much has stayed the same. We have new techniques, new browsers, new options galore. IE is still the dominant browser and it still sucks for developers. I spent most of my time designing the site, but I spent most of my hair pulling time working out the cross browser crap. Which seems par for the course from two years ago. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">With four major players in the browser space along with prominent smaller ones, I don\'t see this getting better anytime soon. Unless of course WebKit based browsers just crush everyone else. But the stats don\'t bear that out yet. (Although, if mobile growth projections are true, we might see that in the next few years.) </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">I\'ll point out that one of the major tools that helped me with cross browser issues was BrowserLab. I got better typography through an Adobe font collection at Typekit, and I used Adobe tools to do all of the work on the site. For all of the HTML 5 FUD thrown at Adobe, I have to say, I think we\'ll be just fine.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p> </p>','HTML5, Browser Lab, Typekit and New Design','','publish','open','open','','html5-browser-lab-typekit-and-new-design','','','2010-12-06 12:43:22','2010-12-06 12:43:22','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/html5-browser-lab-typekit-and-new-design',0,'post','',2),(429,1,'2010-12-09 17:23:16','2010-12-09 17:23:16','<p style=\"clear: both\">I ran into a problem today trying to use ANT to publish the same AIR application to BlackBerry and Android at the same time.

The best way to do this is to build some apps. For my first pass at this, I wanted to see how it would be to build apps with Flex Hero for both BlackBerry and Android at the same time. I figured it would be a good chance to get a feel for what multiscreen development really is like.</p>\n<p>To start with I set up a few devices to test with: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nexus One</li>\n<li>Galaxy Tab</li>\n<li>PlayBook Emulator</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>About Time</strong><br />This is my go-to application for trying out new things. It\'s an approximate clock. If you\'ve seen my \"<a href=\"http://terrenceryan.com/blog/archives.cfm/category/holy-crap-i-m-a-mobile-developer\">Holy Crap I\'m a Mobile Developer</a>\" Series, then you\'ve seen it before.

The only real challenge I had was laying out images. It works and looks acceptable on all three tested environments.</p>\n<p><strong>Lessons learned</strong><br />The simpler the application, the easier it is to handle multiscreen. This app has no input, and very few moving parts. Getting it to work on many screens in both landscape and portrait was very easy. </p>\n<p>This may sound like I\'m saying \"AIR makes it easy to do multiscreen development.\" I\'m not; I\'m saying \"<strong>Multiscreen development is easy if your application does nothing.</strong>\" The app I\'m going to blog about next confirms that once you add actual interaction to your UIs it gets much tougher. </p>\n<p>If you\'re going to target both Android and BlackBerry Tablet OS with your application then Hero is the way to go. There\'s no way to selectively swap in QNX for pieces here and there. If you want cross platform without writing for each platform you have to acknowledge that your app won\'t look quite like a native BlackBerry application. It won\'t quite look like a native Android Application either. There are certainly pros and cons to this. </p>\n<p>Pros:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One code base for all of your target platforms</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Might be consciously or unconsciously confusing or troubling to the user.</li>\n<li>Might be jarring.</li>\n<li>Might look cheap, or somehow wrong.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are certainly more pros and cons than this, but this is what really slaps me in the face. For me, there\'s no question, <strong>the ability to write applications once and trivially tweak builds to get them onto other platforms outweighs the other issues</strong>. However, <strong>your mileage will vary</strong>. Your applications might need that extra performance, or abilities. I have not run into these as limitations yet, for my use cases the performance hit of AIR as an abstraction layer have been very overblown. That being said, I\'m not writing a complex app for mobile devices.</p>\n<p>But how complex should your mobile applications be? From my vantage point, with slower processors, and less user attention, mobile apps should do less than their desktop counterparts. Most of my experience with mobile apps tells me that my fellow developers agree. Which again is not to say you shouldn\'t write complex applications, merely that the types of applications I am disposed to writing on mobile devices are simpler, and require less capabilities and performance.</p>\n<p>Also visually, I think the Flex team is doing a good job making visually pleasing interfaces. For comparison, I hated Halo, and mildly like Spark. Hero\'s mobile components are visually better than both, in my opinion. </p>\n<p>Also as I have posted before, I learned how to <a href=\"http://terrenceryan.com/blog/post.cfm/using-ant-to-package-the-same-air-app-to-multiple-devices\">publish both apk (Android) and bar (BlackBerry Tablet OS) versions of AIR applications at the same time</a>. </p>\n<p><strong>Resources:</strong><br /><a href=\"https://github.com/tpryan/AboutTimeHero\">AboutTimeHero</a> on github<br />I can\'t include the APK as it requires an as-of-now unreleased version of AIR. </p>','About Time with Flex Hero','','publish','open','open','','about-time-with-flex-hero','','','2010-12-21 17:38:37','2010-12-21 17:38:37','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/about-time-with-flex-hero',0,'post','',1),(432,1,'2010-12-22 17:09:31','2010-12-22 17:09:31','<p>\n<a href=\"/blog/assets/content/tr_android.png\"><img style=\"float:right; margin: 10px; 0 10px 10px\" src=\"/blog/assets/content/tr_android_tn.png\" alt=\"Android Version\" width=\"287\" height=\"458\" /></a>\nThis is my second attempt at a multiscreen BlackBerry and Android application using Hero. I outlined what I was trying to do in general with <a href=\"/blog/post.cfm/about-time-with-flex-hero\">yesterday\'s post</a>. </p>\n<p>I added one more device to my testing rig, just to explore differences. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nexus One</li>\n<li>Droid 2</li>\n<li>Galaxy Tab</li>\n<li>PlayBook Emulator</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Tivo Remote</strong><br />So for a stretch there TiVo was enabling their devices with a telnet port that you could open to allow another machine on the network to connect and broadcast commands.

Not because of Hero, but because it was basically just a grid of buttons. It was like a remote you get with a generic tv. My next step was to try a layout exactly like a Tivo. But Tivo remotes are by and large much longer and skinnier then most mobile devices.</p>\n<p>So I studied the <a href=\"http://www.tivo.com/assets/images/abouttivo/resources/downloads/productshots/series2DT_remote.jpg\">Series 2 Tivo</a> remote and took some concepts from it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tivo places the most important controls in a + shape. </li>\n<li>Tivo uses color to call out a few buttons:\n<ul>\n<li>Pause</li>\n<li>Thumbs Up</li>\n<li>Thumbs Down</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Tivo uses a darker grey to downplay the number keys</li>\n<li>Tivo uses multiple shapes for their arrows\n<ul style=\"clear: both\">\n<li>Play</li>\n<li>Volume</li>\n<li>Channel</li>\n<li>Arrow Pad</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of these combine to make it much easier to determine where to click and hit that spot.</p>\n<p>My first pass was arranging the play controls and arrow controls in + formations. I used a tile layout with some invisible buttons to aid me in this. This worked pretty good. With those shapes settled I laid out the controls better. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">It looked more like a remote.</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">My next pass was changing button colors. I made the number pad darker, the thumb buttons green and red, and pause button orange. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">It looked even better.</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">Finally, I added icons to all of the buttons, to make them images instead of characters. That made a huge improvement. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">Finally I had a remote. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">Then I rotated my screen, and all holy layout hell broke out. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\"><strong>Portrait vs Landscape</strong></p>\n<p>\n<a href=\"/blog/assets/content/tr_bb_tn.png\"><img style=\"float:left; margin: 10px; 10px 10px 0\" src=\"/blog/assets/content/tr_bb.png\" alt=\"BlackBerry Tablet Version\" width=\"401\" height=\"234\" /></a>\n I tried a few passes but could never get the remote to layout well in landscape mode. Then I thought really hard about it. This remote is emulating a thing. That thing is always tall and skinny... Could I get away with just forcing portrait layout?</p>\n<p>In the end, that is what I did. It\'s cheap and dirty. But I had other demos to write, and I decided I would fix it in my next app. </p>\n<p><strong>Lessons learned</strong><br />Multiscreen means being able to handle multiple sized screen with the same application. It doesn\'t have to mean one layout shoved into fit all possible device sizes. Or to put it more clearly: When you design one app to work as is on multiple screens, it sucks on all of them. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">Now to be clear here, it doesn\'t mean having one code base that can detect multiple screens and layout accordingly is bad. It\'s just you actually <strong>have to detect and layout accordingly.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">To that end, I would say you can probably do one design for smartphone sized screens and one design for tablet sized screens. You do have to be willing to let little differences in layout go though, <strong>much as you have to with CSS in the browser. </strong></p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">I tried to deal with the differences between screen sizes by anchoring components to the middle of the screen rather then the edges. So instead of setting top and left, I\'ll set verticalCenter and horizontalCenter and calculate locations from the center. This allows me to not worry about pixel differences at the fringes of the screen. I had mixed results with it, and defaulted back to left and top anchoring things for now.</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">I also learned that a little bit of custom tweaking of Hero components goes a long way towards giving your application an individualized feel. Changing a few button colors and adding some icons really changed the whole application for me. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\"><strong>Resources</strong>:<br /><a href=\"https://github.com/tpryan/AirTivoRemote\">AIRTivoRemote</a> on github<br /><a href=\"http://help.adobe.com/en_US/ActionScript/3.0_ProgrammingAS3/WS5b3ccc516d4fbf351e63e3d118a9b90204-7cf7.html\">Telnet Client in AIR</a><br />I can\'t include the APK as it requires an as-of-now unreleased version of AIR.</p>','Tivo Remote with Hero','','publish','open','open','','tivo-remote-with-hero','','','2010-12-22 17:09:31','2010-12-22 17:09:31','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/tivo-remote-with-hero',0,'post','',1),(433,1,'2010-12-22 17:49:14','2010-12-22 17:49:14','<p>\n<a href=\"/blog/assets/content/qnx2.png\"><img style=\"float:right; margin: 10px; 0 10px 10px\" src=\"/blog/assets/content/qnx2_tn.png\" alt=\"BlackBerryQNX Tivo Remote\" width=\"400\" height=\"234\" /></a>\nFor my next foray into mobile development with Flex and AIR, I\'m trying an application with the default UI of the BlackBerry Tablet, the <a href=\"http://www.blackberry.com/developers/docs/airapi/1.0.0/index.html\">QNX</a> api.</p>\n<div>QNX is the company behind the BlackBerry Tablet OS.

It involves politics, persuasion, and an organized campaign to win hearts and minds. <br /><br />On several occasions I\'ve gotten comments both positive and negative about the contents of the book or my talks being \"manipulation.\"<br /><br />One could mean manipulation as <em>\"getting someone to do something\"</em>, which is not that bad. Using that definition we could say:</p>\n<ul style=\"clear: both\">\n<li>My doctor manipulated me to quit smoking</li>\n<li>That salesman manipulated me into going with the cheaper option</li>\n<li>My spouse manipulated me into eating healthier </li>\n</ul>\n<div><br />Unfortunately, \"manipulation\" has some baggage as a word. We would never use it in those ways. Rather we would say: <br /><br />\n<ul style=\"clear: both\">\n<li>My doctor convinced me to quit smoking</li>\n<li>That salesman steered me into going with the cheaper option</li>\n<li>My spouse encouraged me into eating healthier</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div><br />Right? Because manipulation doesn\'t just mean <em>\"getting someone to do something.\"</em> It usually means <em>\"getting someone to do something either using dishonest means, or with sinister outcomes.\"</em> Either you get someone to do the right thing through trickery, or you get them to do something that is positive for you more than it is for them. <br /></div>\n<div><br />Therefore, I feel I have to equivocally state <strong>Thou shalt not manipulate</strong>.<br /></div>\n<div><br />Tricking people might work in the short term. It might even win your game for you. But it never works out long term. You\'re going to be with your team for awhile.

One of the security measures they take in order to use their API is requiring all applications to authenticate against a page on their site, and give permission to the calling application. It\'s a pretty common pattern these days. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">To do this in an AIR application, you can use <a href=\"http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/beta/reference/actionscript/3/flash/media/StageWebView.html\">StageWebView</a>, which allows you to open a browser display within your applications. It has limitations, but works perfectly for this use case. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">So you load up the page you want in the StageWebView, listen for the <a href=\"http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/beta/reference/actionscript/3/flash/media/StageWebView.html#event:locationChange\">locationChange</a> event, see if permission was granted, and go about your way. Simple? Right?</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">It failed for RTM. Why? </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">The location didn\'t change. It was doing one of those \"Let\'s be cool and not reload the page\" things. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">At first glance the work around was to add a close button that the user would hit when the RTM page was done. But that\'s inelegant, and frankly lazy. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">So, I poked around some more, and found out, that despite not firing a locationChange event, it was firing a <a href=\"http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/beta/reference/actionscript/3/flash/media/StageWebView.html#event:complete\">complete</a> event when it was done. And luckily, RTM changes the title to reflect that the user gave permission. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">So, all I had to do was add a check for the title to the processor for complete as displayed below:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"snipplr_embed_50655\" class=\"snipplr_embed\"><a href=\"http://snipplr.com/view/50655/stagewebview-location-changing-without-a-page-refresh/\">Code snippet - StageWebView Location Changing without a Page Refresh</a> on Snipplr</div>\n<p>\n<script src=\"http://snipplr.com/js/embed.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n<script src=\"http://snipplr.com/json/50655\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">Simple, easy, straightforward - hopefully I save someone else an afternoon of trial and error with this post.</p>','StageWebView Location Changing without a Page Refresh','','publish','open','open','','stagewebview-location-changing-without-a-page-refresh','','','2011-01-12 18:01:02','2011-01-12 18:01:02','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/stagewebview-location-changing-without-a-page-refresh',0,'post','',7),(436,1,'2011-01-17 10:56:10','2011-01-17 10:56:10','<p style=\"clear: both\">Saw a great post, <a href=\"http://specialbrands.net/2011/01/16/todays-noise-tomorrows-dinosaur-programming-business/\">Today\'s Noise, Tomorrow\'s Dinosaur</a> on <a href=\"http://specialbrands.net/\">General Musing</a>. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">One of the points I make in <a href=\"http://www.pragprog.com/titles/trevan/driving-technical-change\">Driving Technical Change</a> is that expertise constantly decays. Every piece of technology out there today is evolving and changing. If you stop paying attention to areas of your knowledge, then you will lose expert status. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">The author disagrees with me. He states:</p>\n<blockquote style=\"clear: both\">\n<p style=\"clear: both\">I think this is a sweeping generalization which I believe is wrong, and I know is wrong for me. I regularly go on sabbatical for 3-6 months where I don\'t or hardy use a computer, with hardly I mean I checked my mail once after 3 months. In this time due to the fact that I\'m traveling I don\'t read computer books or magazines. Coming back after this time I notice one important thing, nothing has changed except the version numbers. New features have been added to old software, new design patterns have been thought up and new frameworks have been created, whole sections of the linux kernel have been rewritten. And with in a week I am at my expertise level, and a week later I have covered most of the important things I\'ve missed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">Impressive that he is able to do so. I, of course, think he is an outlier. However, I agree that 3-6 months off won\'t kill your expertise, assuming the rest of the time you are working on it. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">What I do agree with him about is the idea that <strong>there is a lot of noise out there, and following it doesn\'t add to expertise</strong>. He\'s right that following every single release note, or bleeding edge build of your tools won\'t help your expertise. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">But I still believe you need to keep up to date on expertise maintenance information. I also believe tuning it out for long periods will cause your expertise to atrophy. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">The hard part is to judge what is noise and what is signal. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">For me, it, like many things, is like pornography, \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it\">I know it when I see it</a>.\" If I had to categorize what fits that bill for me, it usually comes down to source. Certain sources--bloggers, publications, companies--seem to always put things out that expand my thinking, illuminate choices, and convey tough concepts in easy to understand metaphor.</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">So, sorry no easy answer, but I can at least tell you it\'s not in the release notes.</p>','A Different Take on Expertise','','publish','open','open','','a-different-take-on-expertise','','','2011-01-17 10:56:10','2011-01-17 10:56:10','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/a-different-take-on-expertise',0,'post','',4),(437,1,'2011-01-19 11:43:37','2011-01-19 11:43:37','<p style=\"clear: both\">I\'m heading to Southern California in two weeks to do a miniature User Group tour.

Read the review, I think his criticism\'s fair. However he said one thing that sticks out to me.</p>\n<blockquote style=\"clear: both\">\n<p style=\"clear: both\">Do you want to fight for technical change on your team or do you move from team to team or company to company looking for that great fit?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">Basically, in early talks I gave on this I phrased it a little different:</p>\n<blockquote style=\"clear: both\">\n<p style=\"clear: both\">You have three choices:</p>\n<ol style=\"clear: both\">\n<li>accept the status quo</li>\n<li>leave</li>\n<li>change your organization</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">This was inspired by <a href=\"http://martinfowler.com/\">Martin Fowler</a>\'s quote:</p>\n<blockquote style=\"clear: both\">\n<p style=\"clear: both\">You can Change Your Organization or Change Your Organization.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">The problem I see in Roger\'s question, is that it sort of assumes that work has only one compelling feature: the work. I see this from time to time, and I\'m not entirely sure that Roger is saying this, but I feel in the minds of many people it assumes that passionate people don\'t stay at a job where people are resistant to change. It implies that the people that do want better things have to leave to grow. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">I know it\'s not trendy to say this, but there are times where being an adult means that you can\'t just hop from job to job following your passion. Having a family, a mortgage, and other ties require that from time to time you have to suck it up for a paycheck, heath benefits, and stability. You aren\'t always free to leave. <br /><br />This is not to take shots at people who set up their lives to enable this. They value their freedom, and they earn it by sacrificing other things. I respect and admire that, but theirs is not the only path to passionate fulfillment in your life.</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">This is also not to say you shouldn\'t try to leave a bad situation. Just that you have to weigh your options and take passes on riskier ventures waiting for the right opportunity. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">But while you wait where your coworkers aren\'t interested in change, what do you do? If you cannot leave, your choice is between accepting the status quo, or changing the organization. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">I\'d argue that if you accept that status quo it is the first, if not the only, step to giving up on the passion at your job. That\'s cool. No judgment. It might be right for you. It was decidedly not right for me.</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">Let\'s assume that it\'s not right for you - you have the passion to want other things, and as stated before you can\'t change jobs... then you\'re going to have to change your organization. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">At first that seems like you\'re making a poor decision. Fighting a fight that you cannot \"win.\" But what is \"winning\"? I\'d argue that making your organization better isn\'t a journey to a destination - it\'s the journey itself. So even if you don\'t get everything you want, you can still effect some change, rejecting the status quo, and making yourself a little happier in the meantime.</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">Success at change has to measured by your deltas, not your destination or current location. People tend to lose sight of the fact that between where you are, and where you ultimately want to be, there are many, many better places.</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">Keep that in mind as you drive change. </p>','Three Choices','','publish','open','open','','three-choices','','','2011-02-08 01:33:56','2011-02-08 01:33:56','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/three-choices',0,'post','',2),(441,1,'2011-02-18 21:23:31','2011-02-18 21:23:31','<p style=\"clear: both\">About two and a half years ago, I got my first look at something called \"Bolt.\" It was an early alpha of what would go on to become ColdFusion Builder. I remember thinking, nothing could get me to switch IDEs. Two years later, I can\'t believe I ever lived without it. <br /><br />That\'s why I\'m thrilled to join in announcing the ColdFusion Builder <a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/cfbuilder/\">team</a> is releasing Coldfusion Builder 2 Beta to Labs today.</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">ColdFusion Builder has a ton of cool features, and I\'m sure the usual suspects will give you a complete run down. But I\'ll focus on what they\'ve done to win me over with this release.</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">First, they focused on making it not just an editor, but an extremely productive one. More shortcuts are available, those shortcuts are more configurable, and you can create your own. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">One of my favorite new features is called Quick Fix, which is a little hard to explain, but awesome when you get it. Let\'s say you\'re working in a file, and you know you need a function down the road but don\'t want to stop your flow to go off and write it. So you write the call out, and your editor gives you red squiggly lines telling you that the function is undefined. But ColdFusion Builder gives you a yellow squiggly. This isn\'t that exciting, except that when you see a yellow squiggly, you can hit a shortcut and get the option to generate that function. ColdFusion Builder will then generate the function definition for you, including typing any arguments in it based on what you passed into it when you wrote the call. Very cool, very productive. It\'s also not limited to just functions. You can create standalone functions this way, or functions in existing CFCs, or even CFCs.</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">Finally, my favorite feature from ColdFusion Builder 1 is getting an upgrade. ColdFusion Builder Extensions have gotten some cool treatment from the team. There is tons more interactivity between the server and the IDE. Extensions can now launch in views, instead of a modal box. Finally, extensions can even add their own custom Code Assist. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">All of these features and more are available for download today on Labs. Get it, try it out, and get more productive, today. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">Go get it at <a href=\"http://adobe.com/go/cb2\">http://adobe.com/go/cb2</a>.</p>','ColdFusion Builder 2 Beta ','','publish','open','open','','coldfusion-builder-beta-2','','','2011-02-18 21:23:31','2011-02-18 21:23:31','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/coldfusion-builder-beta-2',0,'post','',2),(442,1,'2011-03-07 22:37:40','2011-03-07 22:37:40','<p>I\'ve gotten a few question about this lately. </p>\n<div>When you do a CFIMap \"listAllFolders\" operation against Gmail, some folders don\'t show up by default.

Basically, you have to create those elements on page load to get IE to render CSS effects on them.</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">I was running into a problem where <a href=\"http://browserlab.adobe.com\">BrowserLab</a> showed basically a blank screen for the IE8 version of my site.

I am very appreciative of his kind words, and thought it would be a good time to share a little bit of the philosophy behind my attitude. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">A phrase that has stuck with me through the years is \"<em>Make your line longer</em>.\"</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">It\'s my paraphrase of a story from <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Zen-Martial-Arts-Joe-Hyams/dp/0553275593\">Zen in the Martial Arts</a> by Joe Hyams. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">Basically the story goes :</p>\n<blockquote style=\"clear: both\">\n<p style=\"clear: both\">I will remember one of my initial sessions at his dojo in Los Angeles where I was practising Kumite (sparring) with a more skilful opponent. To make up for my lack of knowledge and experience, I tried deceptive, tricky moves that were readily countered. I was outclassed, and Parker watched me get roundly trounced. When the match was over I was dejected. Parker invited me into his small office; a small sparsely furnished room with only a scarred desk and battered chairs. \"Why are you so upset? \" he asked. \"Because I couldn\'t score.\" Parker got up from behind the desk and with a piece of chalk drew a line on the floor about five feet long. \"How can you make this line shorter?\" he asked. \"I studied the line and gave him several answers, including <strong>cutting the line in many pieces</strong>. He shook his head and drew a second line, longer than the first. \"Now how does the first line look? \"Shorter,\'\' I said. Parker nodded. \"<strong>It is always better to improve and strengthen your own line</strong> or knowledge than to try and cut your opponent\'s line.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">From <a href=\"http://www.kenpokarate.ie/feature_articles/line/\">KenpoKarate.ie</a> (emphasis added)</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">The idea here is that people waste time trying to undercut their opponent instead of improving themselves. Undercutting an opponent benefits you once. Making yourself better is an investment that benefits you for the rest of your life. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">What does this have to do with ColdFusion? The reason I don\'t reciprocate to haters or bash competition, is because these are attempts to cut at their lines. I\'d rather lengthen my own line. <strong>Show how ColdFusion is better</strong>. <strong>Make it do cooler stuff</strong>. Honestly <strong>accept and answer criticism</strong> and <strong>make ColdFusion and its ecosystem better.</strong> </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">And for those that don\'t believe it can work, I will tell you it can. I\'ve gotten into several conversations on twitter with people. One of my favorites I remember the best was with a Ruby on Rails guy who was bashing the tag based nature of CFML. Instead of fighting the tag/script war I talked about CFScript, and pointed him to my <a href=\"https://github.com/tpryan/GoogleTranslationAPICFC/\">Google Translate API CFC</a> on github. He admitted me might have been wrong, and was impressed by the fact that ColdFusion had unit testing. I didn\'t convert him, but the next time he encounters ColdFusion he\'ll take it a little more seriously. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">The fact is that some people are haters, and will never accept somebody else\'s argument. They\'re d-bags. And with so many of us coming to age in a post-Internet world, they\'re just getting worse. <strong>Don\'t waste your time. </strong></p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">But there are many more <em>venters</em> in the world. They come to something they don\'t understand and get frustrated, and when they do they <em>vent</em>. When they <em>vent</em> about ColdFusion, see it as an opportunity to help un-frustrate the frustrated, not a chance to avenge the hate. Do it by making your line longer, and not trying to cut the other guy down. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">That\'s what I\'ve tried to do. </p>','Make Your Line Longer','','publish','open','open','','make-your-line-longer','','','2011-03-21 22:14:50','2011-03-21 22:14:50','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/make-your-line-longer',0,'post','',16),(445,1,'2011-03-30 12:37:34','2011-03-30 12:37:34','<p style=\"clear: both\">Hats off to Luis and the rest of the ColdBox team.

Instead, they are to be avoided and contained, rather than engaged. The description is broad, and I of course recommend you <a href=\"http://pragprog.com/book/trevan/driving-technical-change\">check out the book</a>. However, I thought it would be helpful to talk about a couple of the characters that run the gamut of \"The Irrational.\" This is one of a <a href=\"http://www.terrenceryan.com/blog/archives.cfm/category/irrational-characters\">series</a> of them.\n</aside>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">The Angry Young Technologist (AYT) is fresh out of college, or in some cases high school, new to the workplace, and has strong beliefs. They get their information from whatever sites are the bleeding edge, and are a great source of information about up and coming technology. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">You might think that since AYTs are interested in the latest and greatest, that they are perfect choices to help you drive change, but they are hampered in their ability to help by a couple of things. If they are on your side, they are tenacious allies in the quest for change. But their choice of sides wasn\'t governed by any convincing arguments that you made, merely that you chose something they liked. They might agree with you, but they can\'t objectively review your solution and tell you if it doesn\'t fit the environment. If they oppose you, they are obstacles that will not listen to any argument. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">Now, not every younger person working in technology is this type. I\'ll make it clear I\'m not saying that at all. Venn diagrams and all that, not every YT is a AYT.</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\"><strong>Scenario:</strong><br />You enter a typical staff meeting and the AYT has a problem with the latest upgrade to the site.</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">\"Why are we still using stored procedures for this application? We could switch to an ORM solution, and not be tied down to the SQL server. \" or something like that. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">And, on the surface, it\'s true. Stored procedures in this environment have to go through the DBAs. This adds an extra day to updates. It\'s also low on the priority list of the DBAs and so can take more then a day. On top of that, a lot of the developers have good SQL chops, and are a bit better at SQL than the DBAs.</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">The AYT tends to find lots of issues like this: </p>\n<ul style=\"clear: both\">\n<li>It\'s absurd that we aren\'t using [insert currently rising language here]. </li>\n<li>Why the hell are we still using [Technology older then 2 years].</li>\n<li>The fact that we have to do [whatever policy mandates] is a joke. </li>\n<li>If only we did [whatever] we wouldn\'t have all of these problems. </li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">Then on top of it, they have terrible delivery. Words like \"stupid\", \"idiotic\", and worse are their goto adjectives. At this point in their careers they don\'t have a firm grasp of diplomacy, tact, or the basic understanding that someone can disagree with them and not be stupid. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">In the case of the above mentioned SQL policy he\'s got a point. It\'s terribly inefficient. The DBAs have other things to do, don\'t get updates out on any sort of schedule, and don\'t add a lot of value to the process. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">The AYT is a few years out of college, so he wasn\'t here while this app was being built, deployed and used in production for the first year. He didn\'t track down crazy bugs in the reporting system. He didn\'t enter 50 bug fixes that one week in September. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">What the AYT wants to do amounts to a complete burn and redo of the existing code, simply to make the code technique (not quality or features) match current practices. <a href=\"http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html\">It\'s a bad idea, and people smarter than I have made this case</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">This one example points to the root cause of the AYT\'s lack of reason, a failure to understand the history of a given environment. Also he tends to not understand that decisions are made for more than just pure technology reasons. AYTs often don\'t get the context of business, personnel, or other non-technology concerns. </p>\n<ul style=\"clear: both\">\n<li>If an organization has deep expertise in proprietary technology x, switching to free technology y has high retraining costs.</li>\n<li>If an organization has expensively committed to technology x and technology y is only moderately better, the utility of switching is low.</li>\n<li>Policies that effect technology are more often than not driven by non-technical reasons. While CYA policies are annoying they combat the high negative utility of drawing management ire. </li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">These are all true, but would be dismissed by the AYT as irrelevant. Most of us that have been around for a little bit know that each of these has a tremendous impact on organizations.</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">Combine that failure to grok things with terrible delivery and you get one outcome: almost total lack of adoption for the things that the AYT champions. He\'s making the wrong arguments, and he\'s doing it like jackass. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">I\'m being tough on the AYT because I used to be him. I thought managers were idiots, upper management didn\'t get it, and if only we did X, things would be so much better. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">How\'d I get over it? Getting beat by people with better people skills and less technology chops wears thin after awhile. Being successful the few times I stumbled into diplomacy helped. Not starting from a position that people who didn\'t immediately agree with me had brain damage was a healthier place to be. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">In short, experience is the best teacher. I wish I could have learned some of that easier and earlier.</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">Not all is lost. There are some positives to be gotten out of this character, whether you are one, or are confronting one. </p>\n<ul style=\"clear: both\">\n<li>Their passion, while perhaps a little rough, can be a great agent of change</li>\n<li>The need for a given rule, procedure, or technology expires before the practice of it. They may be blustering, but they can also be the canary in the coal mine.</li>\n<li>If they realize their delivery and vision of the problem are wrong, they can become a rational actor.</li>\n<li>Coming along without the baggage of the past allows them to catch things in need of genuine change. </li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">Do you know any AYTs? If so, try and take them under your wing and explain context when you can. When you see them crash and burn, let them know why. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">Are you an AYT? After you\'re done flaming me because \"I don\'t get it\", do some self examination. Are you ignoring non-technical factors? Are you being abrasive? Are you arguing against change because it doesn\'t use the latest and greatest?</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">And don\'t worry, my next post in this series will be on Angry Old Technologists who can be just as bad.</p>','Angry Young Technologist','','publish','open','open','','angry-young-technologist','','','2011-03-31 10:58:16','2011-03-31 10:58:16','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/angry-young-technologist',0,'post','',6),(447,1,'2011-04-05 10:28:46','2011-04-05 10:28:46','<aside>In my book <a href=\"http://pragprog.com/book/trevan/driving-technical-change\">Driving Technical Change</a>, I have a chapter dedicated to \"The Irrational.\" These are people whose objection to change isn\'t based in any rational complaint that can be countered with positive evidence.

They built the system that you are trying to change. They\'ve forgotten more than you\'ll ever know about programming, hot shot. In short, you\'re trying to change things, they\'re yelling at you to get off their lawn. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">Now, that\'s not to say anyone with more then a few years of experience is a senior citizen. Nor that all criticism from people that share characteristics with this group.</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">Unlike last week\'s character, the <a href=\"http://terrenceryan.com/blog/post.cfm/angry-young-technologist\">Angry Young Technologist</a> (AYT), I don\'t have experience being the AOT. At least I think I don\'t. I\'m fairly sure I\'ve never been the one saying we absolutely shouldn\'t change something. I may have argued against a particular change, or implementation, but not generalized change. Therefore, my thoughts here are more conjecture and inference than actual experience. Anyone who sees themselves in this description is welcome to set the record straight on anything I get wrong. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\"><strong>Scenario:</strong><br />I was once at a conference where there was a Q&amp;A with representatives from Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, and, of course Adobe. Someone got up and started talking about the current pace of change, and how every year all of us were coming out with more tools and technology. And he got angrier and angrier as he spoke, until he blurted out: </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\"><em>Why do you guys keep forcing me to learn new stuff?</em></p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">And therein lies the key problem of the Angry Old Technologist: progress forces change; change forces them to learn; and they don\'t want to. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">Now, back when I was an AYT I never understood this. How can you hate to learn more things? As I get older, while I don\'t resent learning new things, I can understand why you might. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">I\'m lucky, part of my job is to keep learning new things. Not all jobs build into them the need to learn new things. Most don\'t. When you\'re younger and have less responsibility, it\'s not a huge deal, you can just spend your free time learning new things. As you get older, other concerns come in, like family, kids, housing, health care, retirement funds, school districts, PTAs ARRRRGGGGGGGHHHHHHHH.</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">All that stuff, some of which people refer to as your real life, destroys your free time. When you\'re young, and passionate about technology, that free time is where you spend long hours focusing and mastering new things. When you get older and attached, you don\'t have that time. Learning goes from something you love to do and you can easily do because you have copious free time, to something you have to make time to do. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">And that\'s if you\'re passionate about what you do. If not, you start as a young person having to spend time to play catchup. By the time your free time is gone, the idea of learning new things terrifies you because you don\'t know when you\'re going to do it, and you never know the worth as all technology has an expiration date.</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">Where does the anger come from? What do you get when you combine no time, with years of responsibility, the pressure to constantly learn new things, some of which may be \"dead\" before you even implement them, and fear of what happens when you fail? You get rage, pure and simple. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">There is bad news here for the guy from the conference, and for all of the other AOTs: There is no stopping the change. We technology companies might impact, alter, or nudge the waves of changes. But ultimately we don\'t control them; they are caused by too many disparate sources to be controlled, even if we wanted to. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\"><strong>So what do you do when you\'re face to face with an AOT?</strong></p>\n<ul style=\"clear: both\">\n<li>Well they\'re irrational, so you should ignore them. Didn\'t you read <a href=\"http://terrenceryan.com/book/\">my book</a>?</li>\n<li>Learn from their knowledge of the current environment.</li>\n<li>Engage them and try to bring them onboard without patronizing them. </li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"clear: both\"><strong>So what do you do when you\'re face to face with an AOT... in the mirror?</strong></p>\n<ul style=\"clear: both\">\n<li>Accept that the future cannot be stopped.</li>\n<li>Accept that it\'s okay you can\'t grasp every new piece of technology.</li>\n<li>Be part of the change, which will eventually replace what exists now, instead of opposing it.</li>\n<li>But mostly stop being so angry. </li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"clear: both\"><strong>So what do you do when you\'re face to face with an AOT and they\'re your employee?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\"> </p>\n<ul style=\"clear: both\">\n<li>Build-in continuing education and skunkworks into employee goals.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">This is a tough group, and they are some of the most resistant to change. They\'re also tough because a lot of them end up in management. So avoid, if you can, defer if you can\'t, and give them opportunities to save face along the way. </p>','Angry Old Technologist','','publish','open','open','','angry-old-technologist','','','2011-04-05 10:28:46','2011-04-05 10:28:46','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/angry-old-technologist',0,'post','',4);

There\'s a great summary of them at <a href=\"http://savagelook.com/blog/android/mobile-developers-icon-image-checklist\">SavageLook.com</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">As a developer, your first instinct is that there has to be some way of automating this. In fact, one of my coworkers, <a href=\"http://www.riaspace.com/2011/01/resicon-icons-batch-resizing-tool/\">Piotr Walczyszyn has created one of these</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\"><img style=\"float: left; padding: 0 10px 10px 0\" src=\"/blog/assets/content/iconsdemo.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" />The difficulty with this approach in my opinion, is that you end up with suboptimal icons. For my current cross screen applications, I need to make icons that range in size from 512x512 pixels, to 29x29 pixels. The automatic approach will have you create an icon at 512x512 and size down to each size you need until you hit 29x29 pixels. But 512x512 is so much more room to work with. You could add extra text, more graphics, or detail. At the other end, 29x29 is so small, words aren\'t able to fit and be legible. Often you want to just have initials or one letter. Often you have to change the font to make it legible at that size even for one letter. </p>\n<p>The best solution would be to have individual files for each icon. But that seems like a lot of pain. I\'m sure people do it. I\'m sure I do not want to be one of those people.</p>\n<p>So I want to have one file I need to edit to create my icons, I want to be able to have multiple resolutions of icons, and have each one be different, if needed. But I\'d also like to just cut and paste and resize if need be.</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">My solution: Fireworks and slices. I made a template that has guides for all of the icon resolutions that I currently support. I added in slices, and named them to get good file names via the export. Then I just export the slices to get the icon files.</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\"><img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"/blog/assets/content/fwsettings.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"446\" height=\"153\" />To use:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/assets/content/icons.png\">Download the template</a></li>\n<li>Place all your icons on the template</li>\n<li>Chose File -&gt; Export from the menu</li>\n<li>Change Export to \"Images Only\"</li>\n<li>Deselect \"Include Areas without Slices\"</li>\n<li>Export</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">Now I have one file to tweak when I have to tweak icons. I can tweak all of the icons separately. I can get all of the icons out in one export command. Exactly what I wanted, good and fast. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">Let me know if the template helps you guys out at all.</p>','Creating Mobile Application Icons with Fireworks','','publish','open','open','','creating-mobile-application-icons-with-fireworks','','','2011-05-25 14:29:31','2011-05-25 14:29:31','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/creating-mobile-application-icons-with-fireworks',0,'post','',2),(456,1,'2011-06-03 23:05:41','2011-06-03 23:05:41','<p>I\'ll be in New York next week doing two events:</p>\n<div><strong>NY Flex User Group </strong><br />Tuesday June 7th 2011<br />Razorfish: 1440 Broadway 18 Flr.

I\'ll exploit that to show the new background image of my skin. There are two images for mobile skins: an up and a down. The Button has a function to return, which should be the correct image for either the up or down state... so:<br /><br />I import new background images to replace the default up and down backgrounds of the button. </p>\n<div id=\"snipplr_embed_54891\" class=\"snipplr_embed\"><a href=\"http://snipplr.com/view/54891/\">Code snippet - Import new button skins</a> on Snipplr</div>\n<p>\n<script src=\"http://snipplr.com/js/embed.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n<script src=\"http://snipplr.com/json/54891\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">I override the getBorderClassForCurrentState function.

Mobile buttons have drop shadows on their text, but they don\'t render using an actual dropshadow filter; they do it by having a second textfield behind the first. So I need to alter and tweak that font to the same settings by overriding the labelDisplay_valueCommitHandler.</p>\n<div id=\"snipplr_embed_54895\" class=\"snipplr_embed\"><a href=\"http://snipplr.com/view/54895\">Code snippet - LabelDisplayCommitHandler</a> on Snipplr</div>\n<p>\n<script src=\"http://snipplr.com/js/embed.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n<script src=\"http://snipplr.com/json/54895\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">And there you have it, a custom skinned button in Flex Mobile.

If all of the controls move off of the ActionBar, then depending on your needs it might make sense to get rid of it completely. <br /></div>\n<p>\n<img src=\"/blog/assets/content/actionbar2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"144\" /></p>\n<div>This is easy enough to do in a view, you just turn it off by setting actionBarVisible=\"false\" on the view. This worked for me for awhile, but then I changed the way I set up my application. I followed <a href=\"http://www.riagora.com/2010/12/tips-for-flex-mobile-apps/\">tip number 2 on this post by my colleague Michaël Chaize</a>. In short, I load my data on application start, and push to the first view only after the data has loaded. Makes for a great experience for the user, except that I was getting flashes of the ActionBar while the data was loading up. I can\'t tell what exactly is going on, but it looks like there is some sort of placeholder or default view that\'s not obvious. <br /></div>\n<p>\n<img src=\"/blog/assets/content/actionbar3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"481\" height=\"144\" /></p>\n<div>This was a pain for me for awhile, but today I finally figured out how to fix it.

It continues to hold on to resources, fire off events, and has the potential to use power draining resources like network calls, or geolocation if your app makes use of them.<br />That\'s why one of the first tips you see is to <a href=\"http://www.riagora.com/2010/12/tips-for-flex-mobile-apps/\">kill</a> or <a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/ria/2011/04/20/tombstoning-in-air-mobile-applications/\">tombstone</a> your application when the user switches away from it. In general, unless you have a good reason to do not do this, you should. Your users might not notice that you drain their battery to zero, but then again they might. <br />But I have a good reason for not wanting to do this right away. Actually I have a few:</p>\n<ul style=\"clear: both\">\n<li>As a user, I frequently accidentally hit the home instead of back button</li>\n<li>As a user, I frequently lookup stuff on the web then come back to an application.</li>\n<li>As a developer, I frequently makes calls to OS resources like the camera or mapping in my app.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All these add up to needing to revisit closing on exit. <br />I\'d like to get the benefit of closing on exit in terms of resource usage, but I\'d like a grace period. So, my solution, fire off an event when a user leaves the application, that sets a timer to shut down the app. Then if the user returns, kill that timer. <br />Simple, easy, and best of both worlds. </p>\n<p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/1051820.js\"></script>\n</p>','Delay Closing Mobile Apps on Exit','','publish','open','open','','delay-closing-mobile-apps-on-exit','','','2011-06-28 14:31:31','2011-06-28 14:31:31','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/delay-closing-mobile-apps-on-exit',0,'post','',4),(461,1,'2011-07-19 23:31:35','2011-07-19 23:31:35','<p style=\"clear: both\">A few months back I did a post about <a href=\"/blog/post.cfm/html5-browser-lab-typekit-and-new-design\">rewriting my site with HTML5</a>.

It\'s a mobile journaling application for tracking hard-to-search-for, local items.</p>\n<p>The idea for it came to me in San Francisco. I wanted to smoke. I smoke cloves. (Make your hipster jokes.) However, cloves tend to be a little hard to find. Most convenience stores don\'t carry them. The tend to be found in tobacco shops, head shops, and occasionally at a random spot like a newsstand. I tried searching on Google, but it\'s hard to get reliable data on which stores stock them. The really frustrating part of this was that I know I had found them before. If only I had somehow kept track of it...</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/assets/content/3-ItemDisplay.jpg\"><img style=\"float: left; margin: 5px 5px 5px 0 ;\" src=\"/blog/assets/content/3-ItemDisplay.tn.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"318\" /></a>Now a mobile app just for tracking cloves would be overkill. But as I thought about it, there were a lot of things that I would love to track like that. Ever been a Coke/Pepsi fan in a Pepsi/Coke town? Can\'t search that out. I like a whole bunch of other specific things. So thus was born Finicky. </p>\n<p>I approached this a little different from most of my apps, in that I got design help from the beginning. By design help, I mean a full Photoshop comp and UI treatment. I wanted a different look for my app then I\'ve seen with most mobile apps, especially on Android. I wanted something grungy and organic. I know what I wanted, but I don\'t know how to design it. So I got help from <a href=\"http://www.the1stmovement.com/\">The1stMovement</a>, a design firm who our team had done work with in the past.</p>\n<p>What they designed was beyond my imagination. Hence, why I needed a designer. It\'s great looking, it\'s got a specific style, and it doesn\'t look like anything I\'ve seen on a phone. </p>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/assets/content/1-Landing.ios.jpg\"><img style=\"float: right; margin: 5px 0px 5px 5px;\" src=\"/blog/assets/content/1-Landing.ios.tn.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"288\" /></a>I took those comps apart and turned them into mobile Flex skins. And here is the result. I am releasing it as an Android app first. Then releasing it as an iOS app. I\'m going to have it out on Android, iterate through bug reports as fast as I can, then when I\'m sure of stability, get it onto iOS. For now I\'m targeting just phones for this app. If it there is interest, I\'ll port to tablets. </p>\n<p>In any case, find out more and link to downloads at <a href=\"http://finickyapp.com\">http://finickyapp.com</a>.</p>\n<p>Source is available on <a href=\"https://github.com/tpryan/Finicky\">github</a>. </p>','Finicky - a Flex and AIR mobile app ','','publish','open','open','','finicky-an-flex-and-air-mobile-app','','','2011-08-26 16:56:02','2011-08-26 16:56:02','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/finicky-an-flex-and-air-mobile-app',0,'post','',1),(464,1,'2011-08-29 10:27:07','2011-08-29 10:27:07','<p style=\"clear: both\">Last week I posted about a little <a href=\"/blog/post.cfm/coldfusion-developer-week\">giveaway I am holding for ColdFusion Developer Week</a>.

According to the article IT is digging its own grave by outsourcing various parts of itself to cut costs. After enough cutting, it\'s not clear what value the IT department actually adds. To be clear, this refers to organizations dedicated to IT within larger organizations, not actual information technology, which will continue to be part of our world. But when a consulting company is handling your help desk and device support, and you buy development time for the applications you need, and your servers are handled by a hosting company, what need is there for an IT department?</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">This has been true for awhile though, at least since the \'90s, and IT remains. What\'s different this time around? This time around there are two democratizing forces that IT can\'t fight: the Cloud and the rise of smartphones, specifically including iOS and Android and specifically excluding BlackBerry. How are these connected? </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">In the past, despite the fact that outsourcing replaced IT function, IT still controlled it. They controlled their cost, but you never saw an individual department bypass IT to outsource an IT need. That was because they couldn\'t--until cloud solutions came around that is. I cannot tell you the number of stories I have heard from developers who have asked for things from IT, been turned down, and then resorted to going around IT and hosting their solution on EC2, or another cloud solution. I also cannot tell you the number of times the developers in question had a ginormous smile on their face when they told me about it. I\'ve heard these stories in education, in the corporate world, within innovative technology companies, and even in government. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">Developers tend to be technology savvy, and therefore more likely to do this. So it isn\'t the end of IT. It\'s just the beginning of the end of IT. First it will be developer hosting. Then satellite offices, tired of bad network service, will bypass corporate networks in lieu of local solutions. Backups, more networking, and more hosting will follow. An IT org doesn\'t have to lose everything to be meaningless, but when more is done without them than with them, a reorganization bloodbath is soon to follow. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">Then we\'re on to devices, which have always been the purview of IT. You start a job, you get handed a laptop or desktop, told what software to use, and that\'s it. <em>Please sir, can I have more RAM?</em> <em><strong>MOOOOORRRRREEEEE?????</strong></em> As an employee if your issued tech sucked, you were pretty much SOL. But enter the smartphone as envisioned by Apple and largely duplicated by Android. IT departments were used to issuing devices and the BlackBerry and its server-side architecture backed up this model. In the beginning you could only use a BlackBerry if IT had the server setup. (You could do an individual redirector, if you were allowed to install it, which you probably weren\'t.) But the modern smart device bypassed this setup with one simple little thing: people bought them regardless if they worked with corporate email. Eventually pressure from CEOs and large amounts of staff led to IT having to support it. Up until now the rest of the organization didn\'t really drive IT policy. You rarely if ever heard other chiefs say \"we must use Windows\" or \"we must switch our networking infrastructure to Open Source.\" (I know that in the history of the world it\'s happened, but not as a concerted trend.) But you hear CEOs saying \"I want my iPad to work in the office.\" </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">So IT departments are losing control of the back end and the front end. From what I\'ve seen they typically have one of two reactions:</p>\n<ol style=\"clear: both\">\n<li>Clamp down control</li>\n<li>Blindly acquiesce to everything</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Both are short term solutions that are going to kill IT in the long run. Clamping down control will just encourage end runs, and CEO mandates. Blindly doing what everyone else says proves the argument that IT is unnecessary.</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">What chance does the average IT department have to survive? Most of them, not a good chance. Not at the strength and influence they have had to date. If an IT department\'s role to date was issuing devices and running back-end services they have no future, they\'re coasting to irrelevance. They will be eroded from both ends until they are gone. I don\'t think anything can stop that. The IT departments that survive will be those that do more than just keep those services running. They will be those that inject themselves into the purpose of the greater organization and provide a sustainable competitive advantage to their organizations....</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">Well duh.</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">What does that look like? I\'m not sure in all cases; if I were I\'d be a CIO somewhere, but I have some ideas:<br /><br />In education, it will take a a focus on technology that actually puts information in students\' brains better. Also a focus on making faculty research easier, less time consuming, or with connections that haven\'t been made before. <br /><br />Corporate is a lot harder to define. Clearly it will take technology that improves shareholder value. But that\'s so fricking broad I could say any platitude here and it will sound right. IT in the corporate world seems to be relegated to a competitive necessity and that\'s it. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">Government is also a crap shoot. But the next decade at least of government IT in the US will be about <em>Existence Justification</em> both for itself and its parent organization. Government IT departments that can help show the impact of their organization will be better off than those that cannot. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">In all cases IT needs to put up or shut up in the next decade.

Maybe nobody you know has it. Maybe you thought it would work alright because it works on a similar device. But it\'s embarrassing, gets you bad reviews early out the gate, and frankly is a hard problem to combat. You can\'t own every device. <br /><br />Which is why I\'m excited that Motorola Mobility is up to something really cool with their sponsor booth at MAX this year. Instead of <em>merely</em> showing off their latest and greatest device, they are setting up a test lab in their space. The test lab will do 3 things:</p>\n<ul style=\"clear: both\">\n<li>Let you test your device on Motorola devices</li>\n<li>Help you get your app on the Android Market (They\'ll cover the developer license)</li>\n<li>Potentially aid you in marketing via Motorola Mobility</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">All in all this is a great opportunity to get some help from an actual device manufacturer with tons of experience in bringing mobile apps to market. It\'s tough for a lot of us who are lone mobile developers to get this type of feedback. All you have to do is stumble* into the Motorola Booth at MAX to get it. <br /><br />This past year I\'ve had the great pleasure of traveling with some of folks at Motorola Mobility during their tour for the Motorola XOOM. They\'re a great bunch of people to work with, and they have the same passion for their community that we at Adobe do for ours. They\'re a great fit here. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">This is an awesome opportunity; I recommend that if you\'re at MAX you take them up on it.</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">To find out more, check out the <a href=\"http://max.adobe.com/blog/2011/motorola-mobility-at-max.html\">MAX Blog: MotorolaMobility@MAX</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\"><em>* You can also walk, jog, stride, hop, roll, shuffle, or dance into the Motorola Mobility Booth for the same treatment.

It\'s up and running in the app store. </p>\n<p><strong>Design Differences</strong><br />You\'ll notice that it looks somewhat difference from the Android version. This is by choice. In trying to get the iOS version working, I noticed significant issues with the UI we had designed and the iOS version. However I was still able to capture the feeling I wanted through color and font, without having to compromise too much on the design. </p>\n<p><strong>Feature Differences</strong><br />I was able to support pretty much all of the features on both devices with the exception of mapping. I had issues getting the maps to work in production build. Worked fine in both the desktop debugging version of AIR and the fast compile version of the iOS app. It only failed on the full compile version of the iOS version. I anticipate having them working in an upcoming version. </p>\n<p><strong>Coding Differences</strong><br />My original path was to have 2 separate code bases. I know, I know, this is all about not having to do it twice, but I was weak. The major reason behind this was that the iOS version had to run leaner, because, well, you know, performance is king. There was a good amount of Android specific UI and features that I just set to visible = false. That did terrible things for speed. So I stripped out all Android specific code, removed anything from the UI that I wasn\'t showing on iOS, and generally improved performance. <br />However, after awhile I found two code bases presented a lot of problems. See, I\'m not the best coder. I know, shocking. But I had bugs in my code. And I found a lot as I was going through and tweaking for iOS. But I had to manually copy them back to the Android project, as my git-fu is not so great.<br />I went back to one code base, but instead of ripping out Android specific UI and features, I loaded them conditionally. This gave me comparable performance, but allowed me to run both apps from the same code base.</p>\n<p><strong>2 Targets 1 Code base</strong><br />If I had to do it again, what would I do different? First, off, due to some advice, I made a couple of good calls early. <a href=\"http://blog.kevinhoyt.org/\">Kevin Hoyt</a> pointed out, and <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/articles/caltrain-times-story.html\">Renaun Erikson echoed</a>: design for iPhone 4 first, in terms of design assets. Everything else is a step down in terms of resolution. However, I developed for Android first. I\'m not sure if this is the right move. I think it\'s easier to add things, then it is too take them away. My process had me taking a whole bunch of things away. If I had it to do over I might develop for IOS first, then selectively add features for Android, <strong>BUT</strong> release for Android first. Maybe... I dunno. The thing I love about releasing on Android first is that I get stupid bugs out of the way on a platform that allows me to iterate through releases as fast as I can fix bugs. This isn\'t necessarily a shot at iOS or Amazon or Nook or BlackBerry. I think their approval system does make you think harder about whether or not you have bugs before you submit. But, that being said my problem is not that I do not think, but rather that I often don\'t think the right way. Being able to quickly react to real issues, is better then having me ruminate on what I <strong>think</strong> might be happening. </p>\n<p>So there you have it. One app two platforms.

It\'s a good read, and clearly spells out a true point: There is not a lot of value in wrestling over how semantic your code is for <em>semantic\'s sake</em>. I totally agree with this. While SEO and accessibility are often cited as reasons to pursue semantics, quite frankly, there is a lot of thought that semantics don\'t help as much as people think (examples of which the author notes.)<br />Does that mean that semantics are worthless, and you should just use a div and a span for everything? No, and I don\'t think that\'s what the author is saying. <br />Semantics means different things to different people, but I\'ve always looked at it as the process by which I identify things in the markup. This identification is important because it\'s what I use to go back and manipulate things through CSS and JavaScript. In that way the process of making your HTML semantic is a lot like naming variables in more traditional programming.<br />So I see the new set of semantic options in HTML 5 as more choice, and I welcome it. Why? Because it makes it possible to turn this: </p>\n<p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/1358362.js?file=gistfile1.html\"></script>\n</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">into this: </p>\n<p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/1358370.js?file=gistfile1.html\"></script>\n</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">It\'s not a huge differece, and doesn\'t change anything about the presentation, but does make it easier to read. So it allows me to write more easily understood and maintainable markup. Now that doesn\'t mean I arbitrarily use new tags. I do consider the meaning behind the tags when I use them. But not so much so that I allow myself to get paralyzed by it. Do I care that \n<a href=\"http://line25.com/articles/youre-doing-it-wrong-common-html-tag-misuse\">address doesn\'t technically mean postal address</a>? Not in the least.

Nope.</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">It comes down to this, using Semantic HTML in the hopes of communicating to browsers and accessibility tools might have some diminishing returns.

One of the common themes that have permeated a lot of reactions in the blogosphere and twitter is Job\'s tendency to be a douche. Most people have been negative on this, but a recent article, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/18/its-shit/\">The Jerk on TechCrunch by MG Siegler</a> has gone the other way, stating:</p>\n<blockquote style=\"clear: both\">\n<p style=\"clear: both\">the tech world could probably use more jerks. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">I couldn\'t disagree with this statement more, although I agree of much of what Siegler is saying in article. How is that? That sentence is the sound bite distillation of a bigger point: <strong>we need more and better criticism in the tech world. </strong>That is totally true and not contested; however, I contend <strong>you don\'t have to be a douche about it</strong>. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">Why not? Siegler argues that Job\'s and in his case Arrington\'s abrasiveness had a positive impact. Mostly because in both of these cases, they deal with someone in power being douchy to someone with less power. People have to listen to their superiors, even if they don\'t like it. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">Most of us in the business of driving technical change are advocating to equals or superiors. When people aren\'t compelled to listen to your douchiness, they don\'t. Poor delivery in these cases will almost completely ensure that no one will listen to you, no matter how right you are.</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">Additionally, it presumes that somehow Steve Jobs could be Steve Jobs, give <em>respectful</em> criticism, and people would have not listened. Granted, perhaps being Steven Jobs had to include that abrasiveness and so is unavoidable. But I think once he made it, once he was the great and almighty Steve Jobs, he didn\'t need to use it as a tool anymore. Yet reports state he still did. I\'d believe that his abrasiveness was a slight obstacle to his success that in his case was outmatched by the rest of his considerable positives. Steve Jobs had a huge impact on the world, far and beyond what most people accomplish. In this sense he was a \"Great Man\" in the classic definition of it. However that does not mean that everything about him was great, or an advantage. Grownups can admire people and yet still acknowledge flaws in them. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">But in any case, I\'m not informed enough to know if douchiness worked for or against Steve Jobs with any authority. However I\'m firmly convinced that it won\'t work for the rest of us. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\"> </p>','The Fetishism of Douchebaggery','<p>In the wake of Steve Jobs\' death, some people are confusing the style of Job\'s criticism over the content of it. </p>','publish','open','open','','the-fetishism-of-douchebaggery','','','2011-11-21 12:00:22','2011-11-21 12:00:22','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/the-fetishism-of-douchebaggery',0,'post','',2),(479,1,'2011-11-22 19:46:51','2011-11-22 19:46:51','<p><img style=\"float: right; padding: 0 0 10px 10px\" src=\"/blog/assets/content/PhoneGap-Build.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"290\" height=\"190\" />I\'ve been fooling around with PhoneGap Build, and I really love it. I love that I don\'t need to fire up Eclipse or XCode to start fooling around with an app. All I need is a text editor and a browser.

Being able to immediately preview on a connected device has ruined me for the command line, multi-step, manual crap.

However I\'ve had one nagging gripe with it. The amount of &lt;div&gt;s you end up creating. Most of the sample code looks like this:\n</p>\n<div>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"snipplr_embed_61645\" class=\"snipplr_embed\"><a href=\"http://snipplr.com/view/61645/jquery-mobile-with-divs/\">Code snippet - jQuery Mobile with divs</a> on Snipplr</div>\n<p>\n<script src=\"http://snipplr.com/js/embed.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n<script src=\"http://snipplr.com/json/61645\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">That\'s a crap ton of &lt;div&gt;s for just one view. Not that there\'s anything wrong with\n&lt;div&gt;s. It\'s just you get this many on the page and things start being hard to keep track of. \"Is this the &lt;div&gt; that closes the header, the footer, the content, or the page?\"\n</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">HTML5 added all of the cool new semantic elements like &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, and &lt;article&gt;, which help you describe your content better. It would be cool if you could use them with jQuery mobile. The data-role attribute still makes sense because as elements there can be more than one of them on a page--for example, a page header and an article header.\n</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">This is especially weird when you consider that \"data-role\" itself is an HTML5 construct. So why do we have to use &lt;div&gt;s everywhere? <strong>You don\'t</strong>. Something that wasn\'t entirely obvious to me before I tested it out is that you can totally use the new HTML semantic elements in your code, as it would appear jQuery mobile only cares about the data-role attribute when it comes to picking out your application elements. In retrospect it makes sense. Doing nothing but\n&lt;div&gt;s in example code simplifies things, but it can be done much more semantically if you want.\n</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"snipplr_embed_61647\" class=\"snipplr_embed\"><a href=\"http://snipplr.com/view/61647/jquery-mobile-with-semantic-elements/\">Code snippet - jQuery Mobile with Semantic Elements</a> on Snipplr</div>\n<p>\n<script src=\"http://snipplr.com/js/embed.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n<script src=\"http://snipplr.com/json/61647\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">Now, to be clear, I\'m not saying I recommend you mark up your code this way in all cases. I\'d say a page could be considered a &lt;section&gt;\nas it is a collection of related elements, but\n&lt;div&gt; is pretty much just as correct. With headers and footers, it makes a lot of sense to use them. The whole &lt;header data-role=\"header\"&gt; might seem a bit redundant to some, but it beats a crap ton of &lt;div&gt;s in my book. Finally,  only really makes sense if the content is standalone.\n</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">So I don\'t think everyone should run out and do this.

The best example is the toast that tells you how long you will have to sleep before your alarm goes off. (Pictured here.)</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">I really like the concept. It usually short-circuits the whole item editing process. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">Without toasts:</p>\n<ol style=\"clear: both\">\n<li>Click save button.</li>\n<li>Get feedback that item has been saved.</li>\n<li>Manually go back to previous screen. </li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">With toasts:</p>\n<ol style=\"clear: both\">\n<li>Click save button &amp; go back &amp; get feedback.</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">I wanted to implement toasts in an HTML PhoneGap application. Now I know I could do this with just JavaScript, or with jQuery, but I really wanted to give CSS transitions a try. CSS transitions allow you to alter a CSS property over a set period of time. They work really well for this sort of case. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">So the first thing I have to do is apply the transition.</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">You\'ll notice a couple of things here.

The 3 to 5 year cycle in swapping out technology is dropping. What will happen to the rate of technology change when people are swapping out their major information device every 2 years?

Many, if not most, designers and developers have come over to the CSS way of doing things (or at least doing it most of the time while occasionally resorting to a table layout when they couldn\'t get the CSS to work.) Mixed in with the pragmatic use of tables is the occasional person pointing out the advantages of table-based layouts.</p>\n<p>Tables do things when laying out that CSS designs with floats and padding and negative margins haven\'t been able to duplicate with the same simplicity: dynamic grids, rows that are all the same height, and vertical centering. There are grid systems, and frameworks that have handled this problem for awhile but they have their warts. CSS-based tables are a good solution to this problem, and have a lot of other benefits. But even then I\'ve heard angst about CSS-based solutions (frameworks or CSS tables) basically being the same amount of work and angst as a table for the same result. </p>\n<p>Here\'s a colleague (<a href=\"http://blog.assortedgarbage.com/\">Greg Rewis</a>) of mine complaining about the main angst of all of these solutions:</p>\n<blockquote style=\"clear: both\">\n<p style=\"clear: both\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/garazi/status/152333186368667648\">@garazi: Okay, CSS Grids, can we just go back to tables...?! I mean, really?! #nodiff</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On the other hand objections to using tables are usually based on semantics, SEO, and accessibility: </p>\n<ul style=\"clear: both\">\n<li>tables are for tabular data</li>\n<li>tables in layout are incredibly hard for screen readers to deal with</li>\n<li>table markup adds a lot of cruft to markup</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The problem with these issues is that for many people they just aren\'t compelling enough. Correct semantics is a lofty goal, but it\'s not a goal that clients care about. Accessibility takes a back seat because most of us never bother to fire up a screen reader. Cruft is usually seen as bad, there are other ways to improve page performance and SEO, so this argument sometimes helps but not enough. </p>\n<p>Therefore, I\'ve added a new reason not to use tables focusing on the current zeitgeist around responsive design:</p>\n<blockquote style=\"clear: both\">\n<p>Once you go table, you cannot go back.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Once you wrap your stuff in tables you cede a lot of control of the presentation to the browser. And most browsers don\'t linearize info in a table well because by wrapping it in table markup, you\'ve effectively said \"don\'t linearize this content\". So if you are going to display this info on a mobile device with a smaller width you get scrunched content that is hard to read. Either that, or the mobile browser keeps it wide, but allows you to horizontally scroll, which as you know is a fate worse than death.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/assets/content/tables.jpg\"><img style=\"float: left; margin: 0 10px 10px 0;\" src=\"/blog/assets/content/tables_tn.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"192\" /></a>Live Demo: <a href=\"http://terrenceryan.com/examples/tableless/table.html\">Table Design</a></p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">Your first attempt to deal with this is to handle this with floats and padding and whatnot. You set everything to float left, so when the screen contracts, things slip under each other. This works very well if you know or hard-set the dimensions of your content beforehand. Otherwise you end up with weird outcomes and odd configurations of your grid. Even if it does work well, typically you\'ve needed to add extra structural markup to make it work. Adding the cruft that not doing tables was supposed to take away. And it\'s all div\'s so it gets hard to keep track of where you are.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/assets/content/float.jpg\"><img style=\"float: left; margin: 0 10px 10px 0;\" src=\"/blog/assets/content/float_tn.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"190\" /></a>Live Demo: <a href=\"http://terrenceryan.com/examples/tableless/float.html\">Float Design</a></p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">Ideally, you want something that acts like a table when you have a wide screen and acts like simple block divs when you are on a small screen. So you take some good semantic HTML, combine it with CSS tables and boom, you have a layout that acts like tables when you are wide, and acts linear when you are small. It also lacks the weird layout issues you get from floating. </p>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/assets/content/css.jpg\"><img style=\"float: left; margin: 0 10px 10px 0;\" src=\"/blog/assets/content/css_tn.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"401\" height=\"137\" /></a>Live Demo: <a href=\"http://terrenceryan.com/examples/tableless/css.html\">CSS Table Design</a></p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">There are issues with this approach as well. IE 7 and below doesn\'t support it. So that is something to contend with. I choose not to. In browsers that don\'t support this, it just looks like the linearized version, which I\'m pretty cool with as it is suboptimal, not broken. I\'ve also seen a weird issue with it not laying out things correctly when I resize the screen. (If you refresh after resizing, it draws it correctly.)

It\'s going fairly well, but there was one piece of UI that I was really worried about. It was a little complicated to render in ActionScript, and I feared it might be impossible in HTML. In fact it\'s one of the few things I found much easier. </p>\n<p>On the edit page there is a button for prompting you to take a picture of an item that you want to save. When you haven\'t taken a picture, you see a little camera icon on the button. When you have already selected an image, you see a circular mask of the picture inside a circular frame created by the button. Look at the picture; it\'s a lot easier to show than to explain. My designer really did a cool job there on that piece of UI, and I wanted to replicate it. </p>\n<p>My first instinct should have been to look up \"css mask\" as it would probably be the easiest way if it was implemented. I didn\'t. I instead went with using border radius to shape my button into a perfect circle and positioning it on top of the original button. In reviewing information on CSS Masking, I don\'t think it would be the perfect solution. The images that I\'ll be using in my final product are going to come from source images of different sizes. My method allows me to drop in any size/proportioned image into the background-image CSS property of my link and have it still work as a perfect circle. However, my research there makes me want to explore CSS masks more.</p>\n<p>Anyway, back to the main point, how did I accomplish this? </p>\n<p>First, I make an a link that I\'ll use an a as the interactive part of the UI, as well as the holder for my picture. And I\'ll wrap it in a div that will hold the button graphics.</p>\n<div id=\"snipplr_embed_62377\" class=\"snipplr_embed\"><a href=\"http://snipplr.com/view/62377/circular-button-in-css--html/\">Code snippet - Circular Button in CSS - HTML</a> on Snipplr</div>\n<p>\n<script src=\"http://snipplr.com/js/embed.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n<script src=\"http://snipplr.com/json/62377\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n</p>\n<p><img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"/blog/assets/content/cb_1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"205\" height=\"210\" />I give the containing div a background-image containing the button graphic and I hard set the size to match the image size.</p>\n<div id=\"snipplr_embed_62378\" class=\"snipplr_embed\"><a href=\"http://snipplr.com/view/62378/circular-button-in-css--wrapper/\">Code snippet - Circular Button in CSS - Wrapper</a> on Snipplr</div>\n<p>\n<script src=\"http://snipplr.com/js/embed.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n<script src=\"http://snipplr.com/json/62378\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n</p>\n<p style=\"clear:both;\"><img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"/blog/assets/content/cb_2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"206\" height=\"210\" />Once the container is done, I turn the a link into a circle by giving it a border radius of 50% of the height and width of the element.

Another interface that I wanted to reproduce was a custom input for note fields. It\'s basically a hand-drawn top and bottom to user editable notes with a hand writing font. As you fill the notes, the area expands and the bottom moves with the expansion. It\'s another cool UI tweak that my designer came up with that I want to honor in this version.</p>\n<p>My first pass at it tried to use border images to fill the images as border-top and border-bottom on a textarea. I had one giant problem with that: <a href=\"http://caniuse.com/border-image\">CSS Border images are very unsupported</a>. I couldn\'t get them to work on Chrome, and they don\'t appear to be accessible on a lot of browsers yet including the mobile browsers I am targeting. </p>\n<p>My next pass was using a textarea. I got a little further along, but textareas are static. They don\'t expand to fit the content. In fact, that\'s sort of the opposite of their intent. They are supposed to stay static to accommodate large amounts of content. I\'m sure I could do something with JavaScript to make that happen, but I hate doing that. No rational reason for that. I just feel that every time I use JavaScript to handle a display/style issue, I die a little on the inside. If I can do it in CSS, so be it. </p>\n<p>My next attempt used the new HTML5 attribute \"contenteditable.\" Contenteditable basically says that the content in a given element is editable by the user. This means that I can just create a div that is user editable. The div has the added benefit of being able to dynamically resize itself when new content comes in.

Instead, they are to be avoided and contained, rather than engaged. The description is broad, and I of course recommend you <a href=\"http://pragprog.com/book/trevan/driving-technical-change\">check out the book</a>. However, I thought it would be helpful to talk about a couple of the characters that run the gamut of \"The Irrational.\" This is one of a <a href=\"/blog/archives.cfm/category/irrational-characters\">series</a> of them.\n</aside>\n<p><img style=\"float: right; margin: 10px 0 10px 10px\" src=\"/blog/assets/content/hipsterchameleon.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\" />Just because some skeptics are irrational about something, doesn\'t mean that they don\'t know they are being irrational. They know that if they gave the real reason for their resistance that people would find their objections unacceptable. In short if someone\'s reason for not accepting that your company should support the iPhone and invest in iOS apps is that they think \"Apple users are obnoxious hipsters,\" they\'re going to get dismissed out of hand. They know it, so they resist by bringing up \"the Evil Walled Garden\" argument. If you are able to mount a solid case against the \"Walled Garden\" argument, they switch to opposing Apple because \"Android hardware would be cheaper\" </p>\n<p>Now to be clear, I\'m not saying any objection to Apple is irrational. I\'m saying if you specifically are going to resist Apple in an honest business focused decision for the specific reason \"Apple users are obnoxious hipsters,\" you are being irrational. I\'m also not saying \"the Evil Walled Garden\" or \"Android hardware is cheaper\" are right or wrong arguments. I\'m saying they can be rational arguments (with evidence and justificaiton) but that arguing those things without believing or weakly believing in them to cover up for an irrational objection is the problem here. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\"><strong>Scenario</strong><br />I worked with a guy who stated \"I don\'t believe in indices [in a relational database].\" </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">I know. We can argue many things: what columns to index, clustered or unclustered, whether we should even be using relational databases... But we can all agree that if you are using relational databases at some point you need to use indices. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">But that was this guy\'s beef. He resisted any sort of argument that he needed an index on any of his tables. He showed us articles that said \"YOU DON\'T HAVE TO USE INDEXES... <small>on tables with many more writes than reads</small>\". When performance was effected by a lack of an index, he said the performance was acceptable. When performance was still an issue he went into a long diatribe about how hardware upgrades on the server side would make his performance issues go away in an acceptable timeframe. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">Then we introduced <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping\">ORM (object relational mapping)</a> into the environment. He objected.... loudly. Why? \"The performance tradeoffs are too great.\" </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">Clearly his issue with ORM wasn\'t really performance. He had no problem waiting for performance to be enhanced by hardware upgrades, which is itself kinda silly.  And his acceptance of poor performing SQL was not because he hated indices. It was because his real resistance was based on something else.</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">What was that real reason? I don\'t know but I have my theories. (I became much friendlier with him later, and it never came up.) I think in general the truth had more to do with trying to limit the number of new technologies and techniques so that he could keep a handle on the environment as he was also doing a fair amount of managerial, administrative, and business work as well. When you\'re stretched so thin, you have to figure out a way to contain complexity. But that\'s just my theory. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">Ultimately his real reason doesn\'t matter. Because like all of the Irrational types, you should ignore them. </p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">It\'s tough though, because these guys masquerade as rational types before you realize what\'s going on. So how do you spot them?</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">A few signs:</p>\n<ul style=\"clear: both\">\n<li>Drastically changing objections, did these guys start out as Burned, and then change to Time Crunched when confronted with evidence?</li>\n<li>Dramatic reversals of objections raised in previous discussions, did they go from indifference to performance to performance being the only thing?</li>\n<li>Being a Chameleon in the past, if they have done this to you before, and you haven\'t figured out a root cause then it is likely that they are repeating.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">In general these guys and gals suck. They waste a lot of time because you are fooled into arguing with them rationally since they act rational. But if you suspect you\'re face to face with a chameleon: <strong>cut your losses - move on to try and convert someone else</strong>. Either they are Irrational, and you saved yourself some grief, or they aren\'t, but they\'ll be easier to bring around with more converts on your side. </p>','Chameleon','<p>Another in my series on Irrational Skeptics.  This time it\'s about people who hide their true objections behind rational arguments they don\'t believe in.  It\'s difficult to counter these people, but hopefully this will help. </p>','publish','open','open','','chameleon','','','2012-01-10 00:08:14','2012-01-10 00:08:14','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/chameleon',0,'post','',1),(488,1,'2012-01-23 12:56:33','2012-01-23 12:56:33','<p><img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"/blog/assets/content/venn.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"350\" height=\"250\" />A friend of mine alerted me this weekend to just how much I have a weird fascination with Venn diagrams. I decided to roll with it. So yeah, I have an irrational love of Venn diagrams. But that begs the question, can I make a Venn diagram with just CSS?</p>\n<p>I found a couple of examples out there:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://uxthing.posterous.com/dusting-off-my-html-skills-css-venn-diagram\">Dusting off front-end skills: CSS Venn Diagram</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://blog.w3human.me/05/2011/html-and-css-venn-diagram/\">HTML And CSS Venn Diagram</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>But I felt like they had a bit too much fluff in the HTML markup. Not that there is anything technically wrong with their implementations. I prefer complexity in my CSS and not in my HTML. It\'s probably just a subjective thing, but I do. </p>\n<p>So how do you do it?</p>\n<p>First you create 3 divs. 1 for each Venn circle, and 1 for the overlap section. Each div contains a p with content in it.</p>\n<p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/1664396.js?file=htmlportion.html\"></script>\n</p>\n<p>Then you go to style each of the circles. Give them matching heights and widths, and a border radius of half of the height. This creates the circle. Then give each one an opacity below 1. This will ensure that when they overlap they will form a new color. </p>\n<p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/1664396.js?file=circles.css\"></script>\n</p>\n<p>I then created two rules based on the nth child css selector to color each of the circles. I also padded to ensure that there would be a space to write in the overlap section. </p>\n<p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/1664396.js?file=eachcircle.css\"></script>\n</p>\n<p>Finally I styled the overlap section using relative positioning and pulled it back towards the center. </p>\n<p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/1664396.js?file=overlap.css\"></script>\n</p>\n<p>The real trick is to watch the pixel counts because a couple are directly related.</p>\n<p><strong>To create a circle: </strong></p>\n<ul style=\"clear: both\">\n<li>width must equal height </li>\n<li>border radius must equal 50% of width.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>To overlap circles:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Circle 2 must have negative <em>x</em> left margin</li>\n<li>(Or Circle 1 must have negative <em>x</em> right margin)</li>\n<li>Each circle must have <em>x</em> padding-left or <em>x</em> padding-right to ensure its text doesn\'t spill over borders </li>\n</ul>\n<p>It looks like <a href=\"http://terrenceryan.com/examples/venn/\">the example</a> works across modern browsers, including IE 9, but not previous versions. </p>','Venn Diagram entirely in CSS','<p>How to construct a Venn diagram with minimal HTML and CSS. </p>','publish','open','open','','venn-diagram-entirely-in-css','','','2012-01-23 12:56:33','2012-01-23 12:56:33','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/venn-diagram-entirely-in-css',0,'post','',1),(489,1,'2012-01-23 13:57:16','2012-01-23 13:57:16','<p style=\"clear: both\"><img style=\"float: right; margin: 0 0 10px 10px\" src=\"http://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?center=39.953633,-75.198806&amp;zoom=16&amp;markers=3800+Walnut Street Philadelphia, Pa &amp;size=300x300&amp;sensor=false\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" />I\'ll be speaking in my hometown this week.

However, one of my goals was not to use any images, but rather produce all display elements with CSS. </p>\n<p>It was a little bit of trial and error but I got it working. Basically you do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create a link in a div with an id of \"banner\"</li>\n<li>Force div#banner to be 149px x 149px.</li>\n<li>Set overflow to \"hidden\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"clear: both\">This creates a square display area that won\'t show things that stretch out past the bounds of the box.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create an A link</li>\n<li>Tilt it using a CSS transform</li>\n<li>Use relative positioning to pull the ribbon into place</li>\n<li>Use CSS shadows to tweak the text and ribbon shadows</li>\n<li>Finally I use a CSS gradient in the background of the ribbon to give it the bands that run along the edge.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/1679040.js\"></script>\n</p>\n<p style=\"clear: both\"><strong>Issues</strong>:</p>\n<ul style=\"clear: both\">\n<li>It\'s not a pixel perfect representation. </li>\n<li>It doesn\' work on IE before 9.

The text on the original banner has some anti-aliasing going on, and on some browsers, the text shadow helps it look a little smoother, but on others you get that doubling. So I\'ve removed the text shadow.  Display should be a little more consistent. </p>','Github Ribbons in CSS','<p>An attempt at recreated the static image github ribbons in pure CSS.</p>','publish','open','open','','github-ribbons-in-css','','','2012-01-25 16:55:56','2012-01-25 16:55:56','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/github-ribbons-in-css',0,'post','',6),(491,1,'2012-02-14 16:25:11','2012-02-14 16:25:11','<p><img style=\"float: right; margin-left: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px\" src=\"/blog/assets/content/html5multimedia.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"250\" />I was working on a little demo showing the manipulation of playback rates of audio clips.  The Audio tag failed miserably.  On Safari and Chrome (both for Mac) the audio tag couldn\'t playback the audio any slower than half speed.</p>\n<p>For what I was working on, this meant trying out the <a href=\"https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/audio/raw-file/tip/webaudio/specification.html\">Web Audio API</a>.  <a href=\"http://www.lostdecadegames.com/audia-is-a-library-for-simplifying-the-web-audio-api/\">I stole some code</a> that allowed for playback, got it working, then tried to manipulate the playbackRate for the clip.

Okay, let me tell you why I think this is a great book.</p>\n<p><strong>Improv Comedy </strong></p>\n<p>Avish\'s philosophy has it\'s roots in improv comedy. Improv comedy imparts a great deal of skills that can be useful in the work world:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Creative Thinking</li>\n<li>Effective Collaboration</li>\n<li>Public Speaking</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One of the core concepts of improv comedy is the <em>offer</em>.  An offer is an attempt to create or develop a scene it is vital to creative thinking and collaboration.  For example a group of improv players get the location of a bathroom from the audience. Player 1 steps out, mimes slapping a wet mop down on the floor, and announces in a terrible Scottish accent that \"Accckkk the lavatory has been invaded by the filth again!\"</p>\n<p>That\'s an offer, he\'s created a reality: he is a Scottish janitor in a filthy bathroom and it\'s his job to clean it up.</p>\n<p>Now Player 2 has the ability to do three things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Block</li>\n<li>Accept</li>\n<li>Build</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Blocking is bad. </strong></p>\n<p>Player 2 steps out and says, \"What do you mean filth, this bathroom is a monument to cleanliness\".</p>\n<p>See what he did there? He completely invalidated what Player 1 said. It completely derails the scene, the two of them have to start building from scratch. It doesn\'t bode well for the scene.</p>\n<p><strong>Accepting is better </strong></p>\n<p>Player 2 steps out and says, \"Well if you cleaned them more often, they would\'t get this bad.\"</p>\n<p>This is better, he accepted the reality that player 1 offered and didn\'t just bring the scene to a halt. The two of them can go on from there. But Player 2 didn\'t make it any better. Nothing was added.</p>\n<p><strong>Building is best</strong></p>\n<p>Player 2 steps out and says, \"Yes, and I need to get home fast today. I noticed that there is an emergency fire hose in the hallway. I bet it would blast the grime away.\"</p>\n<p>That is the beginning of a scene where something happens. Something dumb and disastrous, but that\'s comedy.</p>\n<p><cite>Yes, And!</cite> is the name of an exercise that teaches you to build instead of blocking or merely accepting.

We\'re pleased to put this out there, and eager to see what you can do with it.</p>\n<p><strong>The Story Behind It</strong></p>\n<p>I was (and still am) incredibly impressed by <a href=\"http://html5please.com/\">HTML5 Please</a>.  I think it\'s a fantastically on-target site. It showcases its technology and hits on a specific need and fills it brilliantly. I wanted to do something in the same vein without just copying it.  Around the time that I was feeling this, I got into an argument on semantics with someone. Specifically they were asking questions about when they should use article versus\ndiv. Basically I explained what I knew of the spec for article. I gave some analysis, and made a recommendation.</p>\n<p>When I was done with the argument I had an idea for a site:  A reference that would help people choose for themselves which tags to use semantically without being authoritarian.  I also wanted to set the tone that there isn\'t one right answer to these things - that \"semantically correct\" isn\'t a binary thing, but a position on a continuum.</p>\n<p><strong>The Technology Behind It</strong></p>\n<p>Another important thing for us in doing this was choice of technology. We placed a couple of constraints on the project:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We wanted to be open to other people contributing and offer a few channels for that.</li>\n<li>No content management or wiki software</li>\n<li>All code and content would be in HTML/JavaScript/CSS; no server-side technology </li>\n</ul>\n<p>To achieve this we made a few choices.  To go open and collaborative without having a wiki, we went with github. Not the usual answer for a content site, but I think we can make it work.  The choice of no server-side tech (other than a vanilla web server) came about so as to not discourage contributions from anyone.  PHP, Ruby, ColdFusion, some JVM language, Python - whatever your back end, you have to know HTML/JavaScript/CSS. So let\'s not skew one way, when most of the contributions can be made very simply with the front-end stack.</p>\n<p>Working in those constraints wasn\'t always easy. Ray got tired of copying and pasting template code around despite my incredibly stupid protestations that \"No, it will be okay; we can work that way.\" So he came up with a cool way to handle that with some JavaScript and .htaccess magic. I had to come up with a way to provide search without having any sort of server-side tech. We\'re not sure if other people will be cool contributing under these constraints, but obviously I hope so.</p>\n<p><strong>Get Involved</strong></p>\n<p>We\'re open to <a href=\"http://whichelement.com/contribute/\">contributions</a>.  We do all of the publishing through an automated build process that looks at the github repository for the project.

That was certainly an option.  I thought I would have to do some SEO magic to make it happen correctly, but it was doable. In fact, <a href=\"http://www.raymondcamden.com/\">Ray</a> had <a href=\"http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2012/3/13/Simple-JavaScript-template-system-at-WhichElement\">solved this problem</a> already.</p>\n<p>But then I got to thinking, wouldn\'t be cooler to rise to the challenge of a search without a server? Why, yes, yes it would. I broke up my needs into two parts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An index of the site\'s content</li>\n<li>A mechanism for searching the index and displaying the results.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I kicked around a few ideas, but finally settled on the idea of creating a JSON file that had an array of objects with title, url, summary, and condensed content info. If I had such a file, all I would have to do is search through the JSON to find results. So the second part of my search was a snap.  All I had to do was:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pull down the JSON file</li>\n<li>Run searches against that JSON file</li>\n<li>Present the results</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of this was pretty easy to do, and not revolutionary.</p>\n<p>The difficult part was making the index in the first place.  The added difficulty is that I wanted to use JavaScript for everything.  So I couldn\'t just use a shell script or some other easy way of indexing the files. Basically I wanted to remove barriers to entry, so an OS X shell script would create an obstacle for Windows based HTML developers to get involved.</p>\n<p>Trying to do this with JavaScript in a browser was very hard. While there is a File API for the browser, you can\'t use it to point at arbitrary directories on the file system like the site itself, you can only really point it at a sandboxed space. This made indexing kinda impossible.</p>\n<p>I said I had to use JavaScript; but I didn\'t say I had to use a browser. Enter <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/\">Rhino</a> the Java interpreter for JavaScript. Rhino gave me the ability to call Java File IO classes from JavaScript.  This allowed for easy indexing of the content. Now this might be a bit of a cheat since I am basically calling Java, which is a decidedly server-side technology in this case.  I rationalized my way out of it. ANT is required to build the project, but knowing how to fire off an ANT build and being forced to right full Java are two different things.  I\'d love to hear if any of you are put off by this.</p>\n<p>Rhino gave me the ability to run JavaScript from the command line, or from ANT.  Since we publish whatever gets checked in to the <a href=\"https://github.com/tpryan/whichElement\">github repository</a>, and we publish that code through ANT, I could just reindex as part of the build whenever new content comes in. New content causes a reindex, the index is always up to date, and generated on my terms - only JavaScript.</p>\n<p>What it actually does:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reads in all HTML files in the site</li>\n<li>Filters ones that I don\'t want in search results.</li>\n<li>Grabs the title, url, and content from each</li>\n<li>Writes out this content to JSON on disk</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It\'s not perfect. Search is pretty primitive - I don\'t know how far it will scale. But for now, I have a pretty cool solution to my problem.</p>\n<p>Here\'s the indexer code:</p>\n<div id=\"snipplr_embed_63962\" class=\"snipplr_embed\"><a href=\"http://snipplr.com/view/63962/javascript-search-indexer/\">Code snippet - JavaScript Search Indexer</a> on Snipplr</div>\n<p>\n<script src=\"http://snipplr.com/js/embed.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n<script src=\"http://snipplr.com/json/63962\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n</p>','Search, Hold the Server','<p>Doing search without a back-end indexer using JavaScript during the build.</p>','publish','open','open','','search-hold-the-server','','','2012-03-15 16:02:16','2012-03-15 16:02:16','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/search-hold-the-server',0,'post','',7),(499,1,'2012-03-20 11:34:15','2012-03-20 11:34:15','<p>Thanks to <a href=\"http://www.molly.com/\">Molly Holzschlag\'s</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/mollydotcom/status/181829379603693568\">tweet</a> yesterday, I learned there was an <a href=\"http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-variables/\">Editor\'s Draft of CSS Variables</a>.</p>\n<p>Let me first say that I think it\'s awesome that the W3C is taking this on. I think that variables in CSS will ultimately be a good thing.  It will make it easy to reuse colors and other CSS properties.  It will make large amounts of redundancy go away.  It will make CSS files smaller, and therefore give less toe-holds to bugs.</p>\n<p>That being said I have a major complaint with the implementation--in a word \"data.\"</p>\n<p>See, here is how CSS variables are supposed to work according to the draft.</p>\n<p>I create a property in the root named \"data-header-color.\"</p>\n<p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/2136922.js?file=variableset.css\"></script>\n</p>\n<p>Then to refer to that color elsewhere, I use a construct that looks like a function named \"data()\" to retrieve it as so:</p>\n<p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/2136922.js?file=variableget.css\"></script>\n</p>\n<p>As far as I can tell, the only explanation in the draft for why this is, is that it is trying to match the <a href=\"http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/elements.html#embedding-custom-non-visible-data-with-the-data-*-attributes\">HTML specification for \"data\"</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The naming here is loosely based on the form of custom data attributes in HTML5. However, as defined here, the syntax for variable usage is different from the syntax for variable definition (i.e. data-foo for definition, data(foo) for usage). Some have suggested that the syntaxes should should match, using functional syntax in both cases. Others have suggested using a prefixed symbol instead of functional syntax (e.g. $foo) for both the property and usage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Well at least they are aware that some might object to this format.  So let me add my voice.  <strong>I object</strong>. Variables are a pretty standard construct, people know how they work. Make them work like variables in other languages.  I have a bunch of reasons here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Two different syntaxes for creation and consumption seems confusing</li>\n<li>It looks like you\'re calling a function, but you\'re not.  You\'re referring to a variable.  That\'s confusing.</li>\n<li>CSS and HTML don\'t have a lot of overlap in syntax, why is adding some a good thing?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My preference here is that I can just use plain old words as a variable, then consume them as plain old words. That being said I would be okay with a prefixed symbol, like a $ if it comes down to some sort of parsing issue.</p>\n<p>That\'s my major problem with the draft, but I have one other issue with the behavior on invalid variables. Like if you set the margin to #FFFFFF. Basically if you have this code:</p>\n<p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/2136922.js?file=errorwithoutvariables.css\"></script>\n</p>\n<p>Then the p comes out as red, but if you have this code:</p>\n<p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/2136922.js?file=errorwithvariables.css\"></script>\n</p>\n<p>The p comes out transparent.</p>\n<p>This sort of change in behavior might be pretty confusing. The explanation makes some sense:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The invalid at computed-value time concept exists because variables can\'t \"fail early\" like other syntax errors can, so by the time the user agent realizes a property value is invalid, it\'s already thrown away the other cascaded values. I think \"attr()\" needs to rely on it as well, as its behavior is almost identical to variables.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But I imagine this is something that browser manufacturers can handle as they control the behavior of \"throw[ing] away the other cascaded values.\" They could hold on to cascaded values until they are done computing variables.  But maybe I\'m missing something here. But it\'s also worth considering if this will make invalid CSS easier to track down. I doubt it, but until a browser implements these, it will be hard to determine if that is true.</p>\n<p>Anyway.  The good news here is that this is the editor\'s draft, not the recommendation. This means that now is the time to start analyzing this spec and commenting on it. So what do you think?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><aside>\n<h4>Aside on W3C Drafts</h4>\n<p>It\'s important to note that a \"Working Draft\" is a pretty early stage of the W3C recommendation process.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>W3C follows these steps when advancing a technical report to Recommendation.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Publication of the First Public Working Draft.</li>\n<li>Last Call announcement.</li>\n<li>Call for Implementations. </li>\n<li>Call for Review of a Proposed Recommendation.</li>\n<li>Publication as a Recommendation.</li>\n</ol></blockquote>\n<p>I believe we are between steps 1 and 2 at the moment.

I\'d like to try and start a conversation to see if we can fix that.  I feel like I am qualified to give advice here, as I spent my 20\'s as an angry and often offensive guy, who had to apologize quite a bit.  Because of this, I\'ve learned a little of what works and what doesn\'t.\r\n\r\nLet\'s start with a premise.  You said something that offended someone somewhere. They are angry, and they have called you out on it in some fashion.  (It\'s vague, but every example I could come up with might have been offensive.)\r\n\r\n<strong><em>\"Why should I apologize, what I said (or did) was right?\"</em></strong>\r\n\r\nThis here is the major problem we have with apologizing. We think that apologizing means that we are saying \"I was wrong, and you were right.\" It doesn\'t.  When you offend someone, you have damaged your relationship with them. Whether you are an individual offending another individual or a company who offended a potential market, your actions have damaged the relationship.  <strong>The true purpose of an apology is to try and fix the damage in the relationship between you and the offended party.</strong> That should be your goal.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>\"I didn\'t mean to offend you.\" </em></strong>\r\n\r\nActions have consequences, intentions do not matter.  Actually, it would be better to say, intentions can mitigate consequences, but they cannot erase them.  Suppose I hit a young man with my car. That my intention was to drive home has no impact on the consequence that the young man\'s leg is broken. Now the fact that I was soberly driving home, and did my best to swerve out of the way can maybe mitigate what the law says about my culpability, but it cannot fix the man\'s leg.\r\n\r\nSo, good on ya, that you didn\'t want to offend anyone. Unless you\'re a deliberate provocateur I don\'t assume anyone believes you did.  If you were deliberately offending people, I assume you don\'t have any interest in apologizing.  So if you are apologizing, shut up about your intentions. You just sound like you are trying to excuse yourself.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>\"I don\'t see what you are getting so upset about.\"</em></strong>\r\n\r\nThis is a shitty, defensive way of saying \"I don\'t understand how I offended you.\" That\'s fine.  It is perfectly acceptable to not understand how you have been offensive. If you were able to wrap your mind perfectly around the thoughts and considerations of the offended party, you probably wouldn\'t have taken the action that offended them. It\'s perfectly fine to ask for clarification and an explanation. Just try not to phrase that request like an asshole.\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\"I\'m having trouble wrapping my mind around this, can you explain where you\'re coming from?\" Good.</li>\r\n	<li>\"Can you tell me why a person like you is offended by this?\" - Bad.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong><em>\"I can\'t have said something homophobic, I have quite a few gay friends.\"</em></strong>\r\n\r\nRepeat after me: <strong>There is no such thing as a \"ghetto pass.\"</strong> That you have gay/female/minority friends does not mean you can\'t say homophobic/sexist/racist things.  It means that you probably shouldn\'t say them, and perhaps you should check to see if you still have those friends.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>\"You\'re overly sensitive.\"</em></strong>\r\n\r\nThis encapsulates a lot of things but at the core of it you are denying the reasonableness of the person taking offense.  The thought here being there are thoughts that while controversial, reasonable people can talk about without taking offense.  There are two problems with this.\r\n\r\nThe first problem with the reasonableness trope is that it assumes offense is an intellectual response.  It\'s not, it\'s an emotional response. Therefore reasonableness of the offense is irrelevant as offense in this case is not a product of the reason.  You can tell someone to stop being sad because their life is overall great, but if a personal tragedy has occurred, you can\'t stop them from being sad. Likewise whether or not it is reasonable to be offended is irrelevant in the face of actual offense.\r\n\r\nThe second problem with reasonableness is that it doesn\'t matter. Because reasonableness is part of the right/wrong discussion. \"It is not reasonable to be offended over this, therefore you are wrong and I am right.\"  --which is irrelevant, because apologies aren\'t about right and wrong, they\'re are about repairing the damage to the relationship.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>\"140 characters/email/IM is not enough to have a proper conversation about this.\"</em></strong>\r\n\r\nYou\'re right. Happy?  Now stop wasting time and move to a higher bandwidth form of communication.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>\"That\'s not what I meant.\"</em></strong>\r\n\r\nOkay, this is a tough one, and it\'s different from \"I didn\'t mean to be offensive.\"  It happens when what they think you said and what you think you said are two different things.  It could be because of someone mishearing you. It\'s also perfectly possible that someone is reading into what you have said or done, and giving it a context that makes it offensive to them. It\'s also possible that you were not communicating well.\r\n\r\nAgain it\'s time to remember what\'s important, fixing the damage.  So apologize first, get acceptance that you want to fix the damage, then start to talk about the misunderstanding.  Ask what language you could have use to make your intended meaning come through.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>So how should you apologize?</em></strong>\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Start with \"I am sorry I offended you.\" No qualifiers.  No \"If I offended anyone.\" You\'re sorry that the relationship is damaged and that you caused the damage.  Start from there.</li>\r\n	<li>Seek an understanding of what you did that caused offense, and acknowledge it.</li>\r\n	<li>No excuses. Unless you were kidnapped, drugged and slammed down in front of a keyboard or phone, you are responsible for whatever you did to offend someone.  Even if it is a \"not what I meant\" incident. You\'re responsible at least in part for the misunderstanding.</li>\r\n	<li>Don\'t apologize angry. When we are criticized, it\'s easy to get angry and emotional ourselves, and therefore get in the way of a real apology.  If the criticism you receive makes you angry or defensive, then wait and calm down.  Very little relationship damage can be fixed with anger.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nThere you have it, apology advice from someone who\'s had to do a lot of it. It\'s not about winning an argument, it\'s about saving a relationship.','We Suck at Apologies','','publish','open','open','','we-suck-at-apologies','','','2015-09-03 18:47:45','2015-09-03 18:47:45','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/we-suck-at-apologies',0,'post','',8),(501,1,'2012-04-04 12:07:52','2012-04-04 12:07:52','<p>I\'m working on a little demo mobile application for an upcoming project, and I wanted to add sliding transitions between pages.

I like it, but it\'s still using someone else\'s work, and I didn\'t like adding even the little bit of HTML cruft that it needed.</p>\n<p>So I rolled my own.</p>\n<p>The solution I came up with actually is pretty lightweight and is powered by a little <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en/AJAX\">AJAX</a>, some <a href=\"http://css3.bradshawenterprises.com/\">CSS transitions</a>, and <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/CSS_transitions#Detecting_the_completion_of_a_transition\">CSS transition events</a>. It\'s also important to note that this only works with WebKit. (My personal use case is for a mobile application with <a href=\"http://phonegap.com/\">PhoneGap</a> targeting Android and iOS, so I only need WebKit compatibility.)</p>\n<p>First thing is to set the CSS of the body to have a transition on it, so when I move it around it\'s animated.</p>\n\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/2303369.js?file=css.css\"></script>\n\n<p>Next thing I do is fire off a function when the page loads to replace all links with a function that will create the effect.  I use some techniques I learned from a great article named <a href=\"http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/from-jquery-to-javascript-a-reference/\">From jQuery to JavaScript: A Reference</a> to handle these operations without jQuery.</p>\n\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/2303369.js?file=step1.js\"></script>\n\n<p>Next step is to use AJAX to get the linked page.</p>\n\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/2303369.js?file=step2.js\"></script>\n\n<p>Now comes the transitions.  What I need to do to accomplish this page slide is:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Slide the page off the screen to the left.</li>\n<li>Instantaneously move the page to the right side off screen</li>\n<li>Replace the contents of the body with the new content </li>\n<li>Slide the page on to the screen from the right. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>I have to do it in that order.  If you replace the contents independent of the animation, you get weird effects like the page changing then the animation happening, which looks jarring. Or you get the opposite, the transition happening, then the contents changing.  Looks ugly.  Trying to time these proved problematic. The best thing to do would be to wait for the transition offscreen to happen, then change the content, then move it back on screen. I was able to do this by using a transition event.</p>\n<p>Basically as far as I can tell there is only one transition event \"transitionEnd\" regardless of browser manufacturer.  I haven\'t been able to figure that out. <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/CSS_animations#Using_animation_events\">Animation events</a> appear similarly limited.  So here\'s how I did it:</p>\n<p>I moved the body to the left side of the screen.</p>\n\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/2303369.js?file=step3.js\"></script>\n\n<p>There is an event listener that handles making it transparent while I move it to the other side of the screen.</p>\n\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/2303369.js?file=step4.js\"></script>\n\n<p>I then replace the content, make it visible again, adjust the browser history, and move it back to the center.</p>\n\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/2303369.js?file=step5.js\"></script>\n\n<p>Then to be thorough, I make sure that I reverse the process if the user hits the back button.</p>\n\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/2303369.js?file=step6.js\"></script>\n\n<p>Is this the best way to do this?  I have no idea.  But it works for me and I couldn\'t find a comparable solution via Google.</p>\n<p>There is a <a href=\"http://terrenceryan.com/examples/slide/\">demo here</a>.(WebKit browsers only)</p>\n<p>Full source code is available via <a href=\"https://github.com/tpryan/CSS-Slide-Transition\">github</a>.</p>','HTML Page Slide Without a Framework','<p>Little post about sliding transitions between webpages without using a framework. </p>','publish','open','open','','html-page-slide-without-a-framework','','','2012-04-04 12:07:52','2012-04-04 12:07:52','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/html-page-slide-without-a-framework',0,'post','',5),(502,1,'2012-04-04 16:42:18','2012-04-04 16:42:18','<p><img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"/blog/assets/content/modevux.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"190\" height=\"190\" />It looks like I\'m going to be speaking at <a href=\"http://modevux.com/\">MoDevUX</a> outside Washington, DC later this month.</p>\n<p>I\'ll be talking about how to make great user experiences in mobile applications with PhoneGap.</p>\n<p>It\'s a new event and group for me, and it looks great.

They were designed to take some of the grief out of getting started with various aspects of PhoneGap and PhoneGap Build projects.  I\'ve contributed a project based on one of pet peeves with <a href=\"https://build.phonegap.com/\">PhoneGap Build</a>: the lack of productivity.</p>\n<p>Don\'t get me wrong. I love PhoneGap Build.  I love not having to open multiple IDEs to work on mobile apps. I love working on HTML apps in HTML tools - but you lose a few things in the trade. You lose being able to click one button and have your work available on your device.  You miss being able to click and get a pop up that says your work is ready to view on the device.</p>\n<p>These things seem small, but having tried to build actual projects in PhoneGap Build, I found them critical.  I would go kick off a build, and then have to wait for the build to be complete.  I\'d open a browser windows while I waited. 20 minutes later, I would cycle through my Chrome windows and remember that I was waiting for a build to complete.  </p>\n<p>A few months back I tried my hand and solving this and came up with a <a href=\"/blog/post.cfm/one-click-phonegap-build-to-android-device-script\">shell script that handled this for Android</a>.  Over the past few weeks, I\'ve added to, improved, and modified it. I now have a solution in ANT that does the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Uploads files to PhoneGap Build triggering a rebuild</li>\n<li>Polls for IOS and Android to be finished</li>\n<li>Downloads ipa and apk files when ready</li>\n<li>Installs them onto connected iOS and Android devices</li>\n<li>Uses the \"say\" command to let you know when things are done.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It takes the form of an ANT build file, some properties, and 2 shell scripts. I\'ve posted the whole thing as <a href=\"https://github.com/phonegap-starter/Productivity\">PhoneGap Starter Productivity</a> on github. As far as I know this will only work on OS X, which I hope isn\'t a huge problem for anyone, and I\'m willing to collaborate with someone to make them more cross platform friendly.</p>\n<p>Also I feel it\'s important to note, that while these scripts mean you don\'t have to use the IDE to accomplish these tasks, you still have to have Xcode and the Android SDK on your machine to use them. </p>','PhoneGap Starter Project - Productivity','<p>I\'ve written up some helper ANT scripts for PhoneGap Build, and posted them to github as part of Ryan Stewart\'s PhoneGap Starter projects.</p>','publish','open','open','','phonegap-starter-project-productivity','','','2012-05-14 13:08:03','2012-05-14 13:08:03','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/phonegap-starter-project-productivity',0,'post','',0),(508,1,'2012-05-23 12:11:50','2012-05-23 12:11:50','<p>I use <a href=\"http://ant.apache.org/\">ANT</a> to automate a lot of the work I do around the web.  Some things are so tedious I don\'t want to have to do them.  Others just take a long time, and I would rather the computer spend that time instead of me.</p>\n<p>The difficulty with that is ANT doesn\'t notify you when it is done.  Sure it prints a message that it\'s done in the terminal window, but unless you\'re looking there, you\'ll never know. I stumbled on an easy way of getting notifications that are flexible and easy to work with on OS X:</p>\n<p>The <code>say</code> command</p>\n<p>In OS X, go to your command line and type </p>\n<p><code>say hello</code></p>\n<p>Your Mac should respond in creepy robotic tones \"Hello.\"</p>\n<p>You can get it to say anything...

You can make it say anything, so you can make it say:</p>\n<p>say \"I\'m done uploading all of your files to the website.\"</p>\n<p>So make an ANT task like: </p>\n<p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/2776139.js?file=build1.xml\"></script>\n</p>\n<p>And join it with another ANT task like:</p>\n<p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/2776139.js?file=build2.xml\"></script>\n</p>\n<p>Call them both from an ANT task like:</p>\n<p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/2776139.js?file=build3.xml\"></script>\n</p>\n<p>And there you have it.

That being said, IDEs do give something that PhoneGap Build (henceforth referred to as PGB) lacks - workflow.\n\nMy current workflow with PGB goes something like this:\n<ul>\n	<li>Push changes to PGB</li>\n	<li>Leave PGB open in browser tab</li>\n	<li>Get bored</li>\n	<li>Wander away to other browser tabs</li>\n	<li>Remember that I am working on a mobile app</li>\n	<li>Go back and check PGB</li>\n	<li>See that it has updated</li>\n	<li>Pick up device</li>\n	<li>Click download link</li>\n	<li>Reinstall</li>\n</ul>\nIt\'s not the best workflow.  Yeah, I could fix it by being more disciplined. But evidence suggests that\'s not going to happen. I could solve my problem with technology. PGB has an API for answering questions like \"Is the Android version of my app currently built?\" So I put together a little mobile app to take advantage of that API. I call it PhoneGap Build Watcher. It does what you would expect:\n<ul>\n	<li>You enter your PGB credentials</li>\n	<li>You get a list of all of your projects</li>\n	<li>You choose one</li>\n	<li>Any time that project gets updated you get sound, vibration and notification alerts.</li>\n	<li>From that alert you can click on the download link and install the new version of your application.</li>\n</ul>\nThis has really helped my workflow with PGB, and I hope some of you out there can use it to do the same.\n\nSee it in action:\n\n<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/42728484\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\"></iframe>\n\nIt\'s of course <a href=\"https://github.com/tpryan/PhoneGap-Build-Watcher\">Open Source and hosted on GitHub</a>.\n\nI\'ve put it up on <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.terrenceryan.pgbwatche\">Google Play</a>, but was unable to get it into the App Store.  I should have realized it before trying but Apple doesn\'t like applications that prompt you to download applications.

But the prototype is just one piece of that, for us it only works in a specific build of WebKit, and can only handle what the engineers were trying to accomplish in the first place.</p>\n<p>So how do go from there to other browsers as a whole?  Well you write a spec.  The spec tells the browser manufacturers what you want the feature to do, what the API of the feature will look like, what options are available, etc.  You write the spec and share it with other browser groups and they will tell you the spec is impossible because they\'re engineers.  So, you whip out your prototype and show that it isn\'t impossible. Take that, browser makers!</p>\n<p>So to punish you for that, they tell you your spec is awful, and you need to rewrite the whole thing.  </p>\n<p>This part of the process seems to go on multiple times. </p>\n<p>Then as you are perfecting your spec, some bleary-eyed engineer at one of the browser manufacturers pokes his head out of his cube and says \"Look at this awesome thing I did!\" and it will look a lot like the feature you have specced out. He or she didn\'t see all the work on the spec, because they were too busy making the exact same thing happen. Except the API will be completely different.  And not, \"they name this thing height, and we call it clientHeight\" different.  No, it will be like the episode of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darmok\">Star Trek: the Next Generation where they find that culture that talks in metaphor</a>, so you\'ll call it \"clientHeight\" and they call it \"Hixie and Zeldman at Tenagra.\" </p>\n<p>So now you need to \"reconcile\" your APIs.  And by reconcile, I mean \"argue that your way is better until you make the other guys ear gush out pink fluid.\" Then who ever is left standing just does it the way they wanted. </p>\n<p>Then it gets into a few browsers, and people start using it.  Then they start complaining that other browsers don\'t have it. This puts pressure on browser makers to implement the spec. Then someone creates a good polyfill to get the feature to work in said browser, and the pressure deflates. </p>\n<p>And that my friends is how an feature idea becomes a browser feature.</p>\n<p>Now obviously I jest in some of this.  People aren\'t always arguing or asking for rewrites out of revenge. All of the people in this process are passionate about what they do, and want to see things implemented in the web developer friendliest, most secure, most contingency meeting way possible.  But sometimes they are human beings who want to reduce their own work, follow their own agendas, and put browser maker concerns over browser developer, or browser users concerns. It\'s human, it isn\'t malicious, and a lot of time noise will make them do the right thing.</p>\n<p>So my friends, when you ask \"When will this feature be in browsers?\" and I say, \"I\'m not sure\" here\'s why. </p>','Embedded with the Web Platform Team - Features','<p>Sort of like \"How a bill becomes a law\" but with less anthropomorphized documents.</p>','publish','open','open','','embedded-with-the-web-platform-team-features','','','2012-07-18 14:53:24','2012-07-18 14:53:24','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/embedded-with-the-web-platform-team-features',0,'post','',4),(522,1,'2012-08-07 18:10:07','2012-08-07 18:10:07','I\'ve got two events coming up in August that I want to let you know about.\n\nFirst, I\'ll be giving a general update of what Adobe is up to in the HTML world at the August Times Open meeting. I\'ll be one of three speakers, the others being<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/103330502635338602217/posts\">Alex Komoroske</a> of Google, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jerseyschorr\">Eric Schorr</a> from the New York Times.  If you don\'t know about Times Open, it\'s a series of small conferences run by the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/\">New York Times</a> about technology for web developers in the New York area. It\'s my first time there, but I\'ve seen the rest of the work that the tech team at the Times does, so I\'m very excited about this.  If you\'re in New York, definitely check this out.\n\nFrom New Amsterdam, I\'ll be headed to the old one.

We start in Reflow, to get some of the basics, and then move to code to show how to do it as simply and cleanly as possible.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.adobe-max.com/scheduler/sessionDetails.do?SESSION_ID=8587\">Programming in CSS</a>\n\nThis is a run down of how to be more productive in CSS.  It will include some best practices, an overview of some modern techniques, and an overview of some tools to make writing CSS less of a pain.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.adobe-max.com/scheduler/sessionDetails.do?SESSION_ID=8747\">Goal Oriented CSS</a>\n\nThe idea behind this session to break down a design comp, figure out how to markup the vision, and write the CSS it takes to implement it.  I\'ll try and tackle a few common design metaphors in the process. A few examples: iOS buttons, framed pictures with shadows, and vignettes to name a few.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.adobe-max.com/scheduler/sessionDetails.do?SESSION_ID=9325\">Fast Performance with CSS on Mobile</a>\n\nI have the pleasure of tagging along with <a href=\"http://paulirish.com/\">Paul Irish</a> on the tools and techniques of writing high performance CSS targeting mobile devices.  It will also introduce you to ways of testing on devices that sometimes may be a little bit difficult to get into.\n\nThere are <a href=\"https://www.adobe-max.com/scheduler/catalog/catalog.jsp?sy=1\">tons of other sessions</a>, and of course there is the promise of a year\'s subscription to Creative Cloud for all attendees.\n\nIf that wasn\'t enough, here\'s a discount code for $300 off: MXSM13.\n\nSo what are you waiting for, <a href=\"http://max.adobe.com/\">sign up</a>!

There are little circular icons that will float on the side of your mobile device\'s screen to tell you that a message has arrived from a friend. It\'s part of the Facebook Home thing, but even if you are on iOS, the Facebook App uses them.  I think this will be one of those UI things you either love or hate.\n\n<img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-552\" alt=\"fb-ch-single\" src=\"http://terrenceryan.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/fb-ch-single1-300x215.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"215\" />\n\nHowever, from an HTML angle, I thought they were interesting. Could you do this interface in HTML/CSS?  The answer is yes, and it is quite easy. Just some borders, border-padding and negative margin.\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://gist.github.com/tpryan/5486052.js?file=1.html\"></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://gist.github.com/tpryan/5486052.js?file=1.css\"></script>\n<img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-551\" alt=\"fb-ch-single-ss\" src=\"http://terrenceryan.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/fb-ch-single-ss1-300x174.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"174\" />\n\n<a href=\"http://terrenceryan.com/max/2013/practicalcss/code/facebook/chatheads/single.html\">Demo</a>\n\nThat was relatively simple, but it gets more complex when you have a multi-person conversation. Facebook takes the most recent person in the thread and makes them take up half of the \"chat head.\" Then come the next two, taking up a quarter each.  Then the rest are hidden.\n\nOkay, so I need to pull out of nth child magic to selectively style the first 3 items in a collection of images. Set overflow to hidden, play with some more border radii and BOOM, \"chat heads\" done.\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://gist.github.com/tpryan/5486052.js?file=2.html\"></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://gist.github.com/tpryan/5486052.js?file=2.css\"></script>\n<img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-546\" alt=\"fb-ch-multi-ss\" src=\"http://terrenceryan.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/fb-ch-multi-ss1-300x214.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"214\" />\n\n<a href=\"http://terrenceryan.com/max/2013/practicalcss/code/facebook/chatheads/multiple.html\">Demo</a>\n\nOkay, so that\'s all been pretty straightforward, so I\'d like them to be interactive.  If I click on a multi-member conversation \"chat head\" I\'d like it to expand out the rest of the members. This is very easy. Just a little JavaScript and some class swapping.\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://gist.github.com/tpryan/5486052.js?file=3.css\"></script>\n <img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-549\" alt=\"fb-ch-multi-x-ss\" src=\"http://terrenceryan.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/fb-ch-multi-x-ss1.png\" width=\"353\" height=\"1039\" />\n\n<a href=\"http://terrenceryan.com/max/2013/practicalcss/code/facebook/chatheads/multiple-expand.html\">Demo</a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo done, Facebook native interface done in CSS/HTML.  But I think we can do better.  One of my issues about this interface and one that would prevent me from using it in a web based application is that it obscures the content beneath it, it just hangs out covering up anything unfortunate enough to be below it. For me, if I was using it I would want it to float instead of absolutely position. So I can do a few tweaks to make that happen. \n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://gist.github.com/tpryan/5486052.js?file=4.css\"></script>\n<img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-548\" alt=\"fb-ch-multi-x-float-ss\" src=\"http://terrenceryan.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/fb-ch-multi-x-float-ss1.png\" width=\"544\" height=\"1464\" />\n\n<a href=\"http://terrenceryan.com/max/2013/practicalcss/code/facebook/chatheads/multiple-expand-exclude.html\">Demo</a>\n\nNow in my demonstration, I pulled the text to be right aligned instead of left aligned, to show the float edge better.  But I\'m still not happy with it. Why? Because each of those circles carve a giant square out of the text. And that\'s kinda lame because they\'re circles.  A few weeks ago a colleague of mine at Adobe, Bem Jones-Bey wrote an article about using shaped exclusions from the CSS Shapes and Exclusion spec.  It seemed like a perfect fit.  So if you have Chrome Canary installed, and the experimental features turned on, you get a much different result:\n\n<a href=\"http://terrenceryan.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/fb-ch-multi-x-float-canary-ss.png\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-537\" alt=\"fb-ch-multi-x-float-canary-ss\" src=\"http://terrenceryan.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/fb-ch-multi-x-float-canary-ss.png\" width=\"518\" height=\"1466\" /></a>\n\n<a href=\"http://terrenceryan.com/max/2013/practicalcss/code/facebook/chatheads/multiple-expand-exclude.html\">Demo</a> [View in Canary]\n\nThe secret sauce here being the -webkit-shape-outside property.  It basically allows me to exclude a circle from the underlying text around each of the \"chat heads\". To find out more about using shape-outside, be sure to check out Bem\'s article. It\'s just one of the ways that the browser is becoming more capable of rendering a greater number of visual layouts and effects.','Facebook Chatheads in CSS','Replicating Facebook\'s Chathead interface in HTML and CSS.

How do I make this cool resize-y thing show up on someone else\'s screen when they go to a particular website?</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\nIt\'s a tough question that doesn\'t get you a super slick and quick answer yet. What it will get you is a few hundred words of \"Let me explain.\"\n\n<strong>TL;DR: There isn\'t a good workflow between Reflow and site development yet. But I still think it can be useful to you. </strong>\n\nLet me explain. Reflow doesn\'t create an HTML site. It creates an HTML composition. I\'m not just being buzzwordy; it\'s a design tool. You create compositions with it, not websites. You still have to take what you create in Reflow and hand it off to a developer.  If you look at the tool, you\'ll notice there is no facility for adding things like links or workable buttons.  You can draw these things using rectangles, rounded rectangles, and text, but you can\'t create something in Reflow that allows you to click anywhere in preview.  You\'ll also notice that the preview is only supported in Chrome, because Reflow isn\'t trying to solve cross browser issues. Neither does Photoshop &mdash; because design tools don\'t handle cross browser issues. Reflow creates something like a Photoshop comp but in HTML so it can be rendered in the browser and that you can be resized and viewed in a range of different screen widths.\n\n\n\n<blockquote>But, I saw it in my browser, it creates HTML &mdash; you just said it did?</blockquote>\n\n\n\nOh, yeah, that.  Um, sure it creates HTML - sub optimal HTML. You see, I\'m originally a developer, so <q>suboptimal</q> is short hand for <q>terrible</q>. And <q>terrible</q> is shorthand for <q>I didn\'t write it by hand, myself, while complaining about how designers want things that can\'t be done in HTML and CSS.</q>  \n\nAssuming one doesn\'t care about that, maybe you just want to get stuff done while not whining about code quality.  OK, you can totally grab that code and use it to start your site.  The code is located in the assets folder in the same folder as your .rflw file.\n\n\n\n<blockquote>Well that\'s an inefficient and poorly designed workflow.\n</blockquote>\n\n\nIt\'s not inefficient and poorly designed, it\'s nonexistent. There is no workflow there. What I\'ve told you to do is a hack. From Reflow\'s perspective there is a brick wall between designing in Reflow and developing for the browser.  That might be a deal breaker for you, and if it is I\'m sorry but I won\'t lie and say there isn\'t a wall there &mdash; you\'ll only be madder at me when you figure it out.  But I will point out there used to be a brick wall between designing in Photoshop and designing in Reflow.  <a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/edgereflow/2013/09/09/photoshop-reflow/\">That is now gone</a>. I can\'t talk about future plans, yada yada, but assume that the Reflow team is annoyed by all the brick walls around here and are resting for bit after swinging a pretty big sledgehammer with the help of the Photoshop team.\n\n\n\n<blockquote>So what\'s your workflow with these tools?</blockquote>\n\n\n\nPersonally, I design in the browser first and then Photoshop. Basically, my design chops and more importantly my Photoshop chops need work. I start designing where I can be the most facile, where there is as little impedance between my brain and creative output as possible. For me that is the browser and some CSS, for you that might be Photoshop or a pen and paper.  Once I get things like color, font, and site nuggets done in the browser, I bring it back into Photoshop. In Photoshop, I tweak color, font, and base layout. I also refine ideas for site nuggets, and things like borders, shadows, color interaction, etc. Once I get it done there, I move into Reflow.  Of course, once I start in Reflow, <a href=\"http://terrenceryan.com/blog/photoshop-generator-with-reflow\">I have to do a little organization</a>. Then I use Reflow to figure out where I need break points in my finished design, and how I will want the parts to move around. I also use it to figure out what I did in Photoshop that looks great static, but starts to look bad once I start resizing and moving things.  Once I\'m satisfied, I move to coding by hand. I do use Reflow\'s ability to export CSS snippets to speed up this process. I also grab the HTML from the preview version, but I rip out almost all of the HTML because Reflow doesn\'t create things like lists, or blockquotes, and the HTML isn\'t very semantic. Basically, I use it to get the text, just the text.\n\nSo that\'s it, like I said, lot of explanation instead of slick answers.  My hope is that slick answers and no brick walls happen in the future. But until then, I think there is a place for Reflow in a web design workflow, it just doesn\'t get rid of a lot of work on the development side yet.','I Used Reflow, Now What?','Reflow doesn\'t yet have a great workflow for development, but it\'s still a very useful tool.

Try it and see.  My answer: <em>you use it where you need reflowable content that keeps a layout you want despite not being pixel stable</em>. Let me show with this example.</p>\n<p>Here is a screenshot of an article layout in Adobe Edge Reflow.  You can see I\'ve laid the article out in several columns around a picture. </p>\n<a href=\"http://terrenceryan.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/regions1.png\"><img src=\"http://terrenceryan.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/regions1-1024x630.png\" alt=\"regions1\" width=\"625\" height=\"384\" class=\"alignleft size-large wp-image-619\" /></a>\n<p>The great thing about Regions is that those columns remain stable despite the contracting screen (as you can see in following screenshot).  I don\'t have to worry about how the text will layout cause I\'ve given it general instructions on how to do it.</p>\n<a href=\"http://terrenceryan.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/regions2.png\"><img src=\"http://terrenceryan.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/regions2-1024x630.png\" alt=\"regions2\" width=\"625\" height=\"384\" class=\"alignleft size-large wp-image-620\" /></a>\n<p>But eventually that layout won\'t work, those three columns will get too tight. No worries. Reflow allows me to make responsive decisions that really make my content layout correctly, but still allow me some variety in layout. </p>\n<a href=\"http://terrenceryan.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/regions3.png\"><img src=\"http://terrenceryan.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/regions3-1024x630.png\" alt=\"regions3\" width=\"625\" height=\"384\" class=\"alignleft size-large wp-image-621\" /></a>\n<p>And finally when the design just won\'t work anymore, I linearize the content, and I have an article that is readable everywhere, but has magazine like layout where it make sense. </p>\n<a href=\"http://terrenceryan.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/regions4.png\"><img src=\"http://terrenceryan.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/regions4-1024x630.png\" alt=\"regions4\" width=\"625\" height=\"384\" class=\"alignleft size-large wp-image-622\" /></a>\n<p>Keep in mind that right now you\'re going to be limited in using these features in Canary and Mobile Safari.  But I think our hope is that the more people that make compelling layouts with these technologies, the more browser vendors will see that this is tech that they want to include.

I fooled around with a bunch of it, and have added a few extra pieces to the website. I hope to drop a more detailed report on the Conference in the next few day, but for now here\'s more on the new pieces of my site. I encorporated two relatively new technologies to a set of pages dedicated to <em><a href=\"http://www.citizenwumpus.com/terry/writing_iwm.php\">It\'s a Wonderful Mensch</a></em>, a short I made for work about a year ago.\n\nThe first technology I used was <a href=\"http://www.macromedia.com/software/flashpaper/\">Flash Paper</a>.  This has been out for a little while, and basically competes with Adobe Acrobat.  The difference is that like all Macromedia products of late, it generates .swf output.  This is readable by anyone who has the Flash plugin, which is practically everyone.  The whole thing, content and reader, is combined into one file and is less than 64kb.\n\nThe second technology I used was <a href=\"http://www.macromedia.com/devnet/mx/flash/video.html\">Flash Video</a>. This also seems to compete with existing technology, this time specifically in the web video space. This one is different from Flash Paper, in that you compress a file into Flash Video, then bind a player .swf file to it.  The video was compressed to about a 12 MB file, that can be progressively downloaded.\n\nThe thing I have to commend about both of these technologies is that they build on the Flash Player framework.  This makes it have tremendous reach and cross platform compatibility.  I don\'t even need the Macromedia marketers to tell me that. The compression is good, and  it was also extremely easy to create the .swf files and embed them into my webpages. Another thing about them was the ease of creating them.  It took me all of about 5 seconds to create the Flash Paper .swf. (In fact I did it on the plane back from New Orleans)  The video took me a little longer, but then that\'s video. The swf player interface for it took a few seconds.\n\nCheck out these features at:\n<em><a href=\"http://www.citizenwumpus.com/terry/writing_iwm.php\">It\'s a Wonderful Mensch</a></em> ','Back from MAXX','','publish','open','open','','back_from_maxx','','','2004-11-06 00:02:20','2004-11-06 00:02:20','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/back_from_maxx',0,'post','',0),(651,1,'2013-09-26 11:37:22','2013-09-26 15:37:22','','reflow-cleaner-org-orig','','inherit','open','open','','reflow-cleaner-org-orig','','','2013-09-26 11:37:22','2013-09-26 15:37:22','',638,'http://terrenceryan.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/reflow-cleaner-org-orig.png',0,'attachment','image/png',0),(652,1,'2013-09-26 11:40:39','2013-09-26 15:40:39','','reflow-cleaner-colors','','inherit','open','open','','reflow-cleaner-colors','','','2013-09-26 11:40:39','2013-09-26 15:40:39','',638,'http://terrenceryan.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/reflow-cleaner-colors.png',0,'attachment','image/png',0),(655,1,'2013-09-26 12:05:41','2013-09-26 16:05:41','','reflow-brackets-workflow-square','','inherit','open','open','','reflow-brackets-workflow-square','','','2013-09-26 12:05:41','2013-09-26 16:05:41','',683,'http://terrenceryan.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/reflow-brackets-workflow-square.png',0,'attachment','image/png',0),(656,1,'2013-09-26 12:05:42','2013-09-26 16:05:42','','reflow-brackets-workflow','','inherit','open','open','','reflow-brackets-workflow','','','2013-09-26 12:05:42','2013-09-26 16:05:42','',638,'http://terrenceryan.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/reflow-brackets-workflow.png',0,'attachment','image/png',0),(658,1,'2013-10-28 17:28:14','2013-10-28 21:28:14','I’ve been doing a bunch of tweaking of Apache files on my development machine because I had to do some machine hopping.  In the course of doing that I found myself wishing there was syntax support for Apache config files in <a href=\"http://www.brackets.io/\">Brackets</a>.  I looked; I couldn’t find it.  If I want it, I have to do it.  <a href=\"https://github.com/tpryan/Brackets-Apache\">So I did.</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://terrenceryan.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/brackets_apache.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-662\" alt=\"brackets_apache\" src=\"http://terrenceryan.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/brackets_apache-758x1024.png\" width=\"625\" height=\"844\" /></a>\n\nIt’s pretty simple, considering that it is a <a href=\"http://codemirror.net/doc/manual.html#modeapi\">CodeMirror Mode</a>, and I don’t really understand how it all works.  It provides syntax highlighting for .conf files and .htaccess files.\n\nHere’s <a href=\"https://github.com/tpryan/Brackets-Apache\">the GitHub repository</a>; if I get any interest I’ll add it to the <a href=\"https://brackets-registry.aboutweb.com/\">Brackets Extension Registry</a>. I’d love to get some other eyes on it to make sure I’m not doing anything colossally stupid.','Apache Config file support for Brackets','','publish','open','closed','','apache-config-file-support-for-brackets','','','2013-10-28 17:28:14','2013-10-28 21:28:14','',0,'http://http://terrenceryan.com/blog//blog/index.php/blog/index.php/?p=658',0,'post','',1),(662,1,'2013-10-28 17:30:35','2013-10-28 21:30:35','','brackets_apache','','inherit','open','open','','brackets_apache','','','2013-10-28 17:30:35','2013-10-28 21:30:35','',658,'http://terrenceryan.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/brackets_apache.png',0,'attachment','image/png',0),(674,1,'2014-01-28 16:44:07','2014-01-28 21:44:07','<a href=\"http://terrenceryan.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/panma.jpg\"><img src=\"http://terrenceryan.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/panma.jpg\" alt=\"panma\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-677\" /></a>I\'ll be speaking in the Philadelphia area this Thursday January 30th at the monthly Meeting of PANMA.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.panma.org/\">PANMA</a> for anyone not acquainted with them is the Philadelphia Area New Media Association.  It’s a great group of people and it’s a great opportunity to network with people from various viewpoints in the digital world.  \n\nI’ll be talking about getting your websites to work on mobile devices.  It’s a departure for me from my normal schtick.  I normally push responsive web design as the only real option, and recommend that you use Adobe Edge Reflow for it.

I must know. \r\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ThinkCreativeKC\">ThinkCreativeKC</a>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\nI figured I would give answering it a go. Keep in mind that I did this 5 years ago when Adobe was trying to do very different things.  I don’t know that this would land you at Adobe anymore. I distinctly think it wouldn’t. See the job I originally landed was \"Developer Evangelist.\" I slowly morphed into being a broader design focused evangelist over the past 5 years as Adobe\'s focus on developers waned and more and more people were focused on Creative Cloud.  So this wouldn\'t work at Adobe today but it could land you at a developer focused evangelism/advocate role at another company. \r\n\r\n<strong>Discover the role </strong>\r\nMy first introduction to the idea of an evangelist was Ben Forta in his role as ColdFusion Evangelist.  I remember at the time being wowed that there existed a job where you had to fool around with new technology, blog about it, and talk about it at conferences. That seemed like a dream job, and I figured it wasn’t a career that you could plan for.  It wasn’t until later I discovered that Ben wasn’t in a one off situation. There were developer evangelists all over the place. \r\n\r\n<strong>Network for the role</strong>\r\nA good friend of mine whom I met working at The Wharton School, Ryan Stewart, also was very much into the idea of being an evangelist.  He ended up in the role before me and confirmed for me that was in fact an awesome job and that I could would be a good fit. I also met the a couple people connected with the product I really wanted to evangelize, ColdFusion. I connected with Ben Forta, Adam Lehman, and a few of the product managers.  I also participated in the pre releases for the product, and got myself involved with Adobe\'s user group community. All of these things gave me good connections and good name recognition with the people who would hire for the evangelist position. That wasn’t necessarily the reason I was doing any of it at the time. I was doing it cause I loved playing with the latest and greatest tech, and the community was very rewarding, but in retrospect these things helped me a lot. \r\n\r\n<strong>Prepare for the role</strong>\r\nAt some point I decided I wanted the role, and I constructed the outline of a 5 year plan for getting the job. I looked at  the externals of what an evangelist did. They experimented with the technology, showed how you could integrate it into other technology, and then they blogged about it and spoke at conferences.  So I played with tech, got it to do new things, and then blogged and spoke about them.  The idea was to prove I could do the job, before I was actually doing the job. This combined with my networking led to bigger and better speaking gigs, which allowed me to network more, which became a positive feedback loop. \r\n\r\n<strong>Get Lucky</strong>\r\nAt this point I was a member of a pool of likely candidates for the role.  I had applied once before. I knew everybody involved and had shown I could do the job.  Then my friend Adam Lehman got hit by a car in London and was travel limited for a few months creating an opening for a replacement.  And just like that my 5 year plan happened in 2. Luckily Adam recovered, and went on to do great things in product management. But it’s a terrible way to luck into a job. \r\n\r\nFor me it came down to being the right person and the right place at the right time. Some of that is preparation, and some of that is luck. You can control being the right person, in my case prepping for the role.  You can have some control getting yourself in the right place, getting myself on the short list was partially in my control, by networking, but someone else made the call to keep me on that short list. And I had no control over Adam being hit by the car despite what some people may claim. \r\n\r\nSome of these things would have to be updated for the current moment.  Do you have to blog? Or is tweeting a combination of gist\'s and github projects enough? Maybe, maybe not, but the main point here is that you have to explore tech and then share your findings. Are corporate sponsored users groups still as impactful? Or do you need to focus on meetups and regional conferences?  Again the details aren\'t as important as the fact that you are finding where peers and trend setters are, and engaging with them there.\r\n\r\nSo there you have it.  Pretty much the way you get any other role.

I must know. \r\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ThinkCreativeKC\">ThinkCreativeKC</a>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\nI figured I would give answering it a go. Keep in mind that I did this 5 years ago when Adobe was trying to do very different things.  I don’t know that this would land you at Adobe anymore. I distinctly think it wouldn’t. See the job I originally landed was \"Developer Evangelist.\" I slowly morphed into being a broader design focused evangelist over the past 5 years as Adobe\'s focus on developers waned and more and more people were focused on Creative Cloud.  So this wouldn\'t work at Adobe today but it could land you at a developer focused evangelism/advocate role at another company. \r\n\r\n<strong>Discover the role </strong>\r\nMy first introduction to the idea of an evangelist was Ben Forta in his role as ColdFusion Evangelist.  I remember at the time being wowed that there existed a job where you had to fool around with new technology, blog about it, and talk about it at conferences. That seemed like a dream job, and I figured it wasn’t a career that you could plan for.  It wasn’t until later I discovered that Ben wasn’t in a one off situation. There were developer evangelists all over the place. \r\n\r\n<strong>Network for the role</strong>\r\nA good friend of mine whom met working at The Wharton School, Ryan Stewart, also was very much into the idea of being an evangelist.  He ended up in the role before me and confirmed for me that was in fact an awesome job and that I could would be a good fit. I also met the a couple people connected with the product I really wanted to evangelize, ColdFusion. I connected with Ben Forta, Adam Lehman, and a few of the product managers.  I also participated in the pre releases for the product, and got myself involved with Adobe\'s user group community. All of these things gave me good connections and good name recognition with the people who would hire for the evangelist position. That wasn’t necessarily the reason I was doing any of it at the time. I was doing it cause I loved playing with the latest and greatest tech, and the community was very rewarding, but in retrospect these things helped me a lot. \r\n\r\n<strong>Prepare for the role</strong>\r\nAt some point I decided I wanted the role, and I constructed the outline of a 5 year plan for getting the job. I looked at  the externals of what an evangelist did. They experimented with the technology, showed how you could integrate it into other technology, and then they blogged about it and spoke at conferences.  So I played with tech, got it to do new things, and then blogged and spoke about them.  The idea was to prove I could do the job, before I was actually doing the job. This combined with my networking led to bigger and better speaking gigs, which allowed me to network more, which became a positive feedback loop. \r\n\r\n<strong>Get Lucky</strong>\r\nAt this point I was a member of a pool of likely candidates for the role.  I had applied once before. I knew everybody involved and had shown I could do the job.  Then my friend Adam Lehman got hit by a car in London and was travel limited for a few months creating an opening for a replacement.  And just like that my 5 year plan happened in 2. Luckily Adam recovered, and went on to do great things in product management. But it’s a terrible way to luck into a job. \r\n\r\nFor me it came down to being the right person and the right place at the right time. Some of that is preparation, and some of that is luck. You can control being the right person, in my case prepping for the role.  You can have some control getting yourself in the right place, getting myself on the short list was partially in my control, by networking, but someone else made the call to keep me on that short list. And I had no control over Adam being hit by the car despite what some people may claim. \r\n\r\nSome of these things would have to be updated for the current moment.  Do you have to blog? Or is tweeting a combination of gist\'s and github projects enough? Maybe, maybe not, but the main point here is that you have to explore tech and then share your findings. Are corporate sponsored users groups still as impactful? Or do you need to focus on meetups and regional conferences?  Again the details aren\'t as important as the fact that you are finding where peers and trend setters are, and engaging with them there.\r\n\r\nSo there you have it.  Pretty much the way you get any other role.  Figure out you want it, prepare your skill set for it, network with the people who do the hiring, and then <del datetime=\"2014-10-15T14:54:06+00:00\">assassinate anyone in your way</del> be ready to take the opportunity if it comes up.  \r\n ','','','inherit','open','open','','712-revision-v1','','','2014-10-15 15:15:59','2014-10-15 15:15:59','',712,'https://digital-axon-666.appspot.com/blog/index.php/712-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(714,1,'2014-10-15 15:16:16','2014-10-15 15:16:16','Yesterday via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ThinkCreativeKC/status/522030195788632064\">twitter</a>, I was asked a <a href=\"http://terrenceryan.com/blog/index.php/goodbye-adobe/\">very ironic question</a>: \r\n\r\n<blockquote>So tell me @tpryan how does one become an @Adobe evangelist?!

It’s a similar role to what I’ve done before: go out to events or reach out online, and talk to people about technology that can help them. But Advocates are less about marketing than Evangelists, and more about product improvement.  The idea is that while we’re out talking to people, we listen to their feedback and bring it back to the product teams. Evangelists do that too, but my gut feeling is that organizations with “Advocates” take that feedback much more seriously.\r\n\r\nI’ll be talking about an awesome product. Or more accurately, suite of products. From Platform as Service and Virtual Machines to Storage, Databases, and Big Data queries, there is a lot to talk about, and lots of rabbit holes to wander down. I intend to wander down a few of them and bring you all along.\r\n\r\nI’ll be talking to developers again, which is awesome. The past few years found me drifting further and further away from the developer communities that inspired me to get into this line of work 6 years ago. My work angst for the past 12 months and the work and projects I did to prepare for and secure this job made it very clear that this is what I really want to be doing.\r\n\r\nI’m joining a team of intimidatingly smart people. And I do mean “intimidatingly” cause the interview process is as challenging as all the rumors make it out to be. But everyone I met along the process were incredible to interview with, and I can’t wait to start working with them.\r\n\r\nI find myself reporting once again to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gregsramblings\">Greg Wilson</a>, and I honestly couldn’t be any happier about that. Good managers are both rare and more important than people think they are. When you find one, count yourself lucky, and if you can work for a manager you’ve confirmed is good, well, you do it. \r\n\r\nGoogle culture encourages workers to informally collaborate. They find that keeping people in the same space yields better collaboration. And despite all of the advantages to working remotely I missed the serendipitous hallway meetings. So after 6 years remote, I find myself returning to daily commutes. I always said I couldn’t go back - but then again, when there is free Coke Zero, showers, nap pods, and brilliant co-workers -  maybe it might be even better than working from home. I’ll miss seeing my kids the way I used to, but frankly, now that they’re in school, I don’t see them as much as I’d like to anyway.\r\n\r\nYou might be asking: Hey, does Google have an office in Philadelphia? Actually <a href=\"http://www.google.com/about/careers/locations/philadelphia/\">they appear to</a>, but it’s not an office with any Cloud engineers. So my family and I are leaving Philadelphia for somewhere in the Bay Area, probably San Jose. This was not an easy choice, but I am very excited about the prospect. We’ll be around for the rest of 2014, with us moving in the beginning of 2015.\r\n\r\nSo let me finish by pointing out that none of this would be possible with out the encouragement and support of my wife, Janice. She was my practice interviewer, cheerleader, and sounding board.  When the very people interviewing you point out that “Imposter Syndrome” is a huge part of the interview process, it’s hard to not to get lost in your head second guessing yourself. Janice was consistently convinced that I could get the position, and even helped me convince myself sometimes.  And when I did get it, she agreed to move across the country to a place where we have no roots, with 2 children in tow. Not only did she agree to it, she embraced it for the opportunity it is. That doesn’t mean it isn’t terrifying for the both of us, but at least for me it is less so, \'cause she’s going to be by my side. \r\n\r\nSo there you have it, lots of change, I think they’re awesome changes, and I can’t wait.

I must know. \r\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ThinkCreativeKC\">ThinkCreativeKC</a>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\nI figured I would give answering it a go. Keep in mind that I did this 5 years ago when Adobe was trying to do very different things.  I don’t know that this would land you at Adobe anymore. I distinctly think it wouldn’t. See the job I originally landed was \"Developer Evangelist.\" I slowly morphed into being a broader design focused evangelist over the past 5 years as Adobe\'s focus on developers waned and more and more people were focused on Creative Cloud.  So this wouldn\'t work at Adobe today but it could land you at a developer focused evangelism/advocate role at another company. \r\n\r\n<strong>Discover the role </strong>\r\nMy first introduction to the idea of an evangelist was Ben Forta in his role as ColdFusion Evangelist.  I remember at the time being wowed that there existed a job where you had to fool around with new technology, blog about it, and talk about it at conferences. That seemed like a dream job, and I figured it wasn’t a career that you could plan for.  It wasn’t until later I discovered that Ben wasn’t in a one off situation. There were developer evangelists all over the place. \r\n\r\n<strong>Network for the role</strong>\r\nA good friend of mine whom I met working at The Wharton School, Ryan Stewart, also was very much into the idea of being an evangelist.  He ended up in the role before me and confirmed for me that was in fact an awesome job and that I could would be a good fit. I also met the a couple people connected with the product I really wanted to evangelize, ColdFusion. I connected with Ben Forta, Adam Lehman, and a few of the product managers.  I also participated in the pre releases for the product, and got myself involved with Adobe\'s user group community. All of these things gave me good connections and good name recognition with the people who would hire for the evangelist position. That wasn’t necessarily the reason I was doing any of it at the time. I was doing it cause I loved playing with the latest and greatest tech, and the community was very rewarding, but in retrospect these things helped me a lot. \r\n\r\n<strong>Prepare for the role</strong>\r\nAt some point I decided I wanted the role, and I constructed the outline of a 5 year plan for getting the job. I looked at  the externals of what an evangelist did. They experimented with the technology, showed how you could integrate it into other technology, and then they blogged about it and spoke at conferences.  So I played with tech, got it to do new things, and then blogged and spoke about them.  The idea was to prove I could do the job, before I was actually doing the job. This combined with my networking led to bigger and better speaking gigs, which allowed me to network more, which became a positive feedback loop. \r\n\r\n<strong>Get Lucky</strong>\r\nAt this point I was a member of a pool of likely candidates for the role.  I had applied once before. I knew everybody involved and had shown I could do the job.  Then my friend Adam Lehman got hit by a car in London and was travel limited for a few months creating an opening for a replacement.  And just like that my 5 year plan happened in 2. Luckily Adam recovered, and went on to do great things in product management. But it’s a terrible way to luck into a job. \r\n\r\nFor me it came down to being the right person and the right place at the right time. Some of that is preparation, and some of that is luck. You can control being the right person, in my case prepping for the role.  You can have some control getting yourself in the right place, getting myself on the short list was partially in my control, by networking, but someone else made the call to keep me on that short list. And I had no control over Adam being hit by the car despite what some people may claim. \r\n\r\nSome of these things would have to be updated for the current moment.  Do you have to blog? Or is tweeting a combination of gist\'s and github projects enough? Maybe, maybe not, but the main point here is that you have to explore tech and then share your findings. Are corporate sponsored users groups still as impactful? Or do you need to focus on meetups and regional conferences?  Again the details aren\'t as important as the fact that you are finding where peers and trend setters are, and engaging with them there.\r\n\r\nSo there you have it.  Pretty much the way you get any other role.  Figure out you want it, prepare your skill set for it, network with the people who do the hiring, and then <del datetime=\"2014-10-15T14:54:06+00:00\">assassinate anyone in your way</del> be ready to take the opportunity if it comes up.  \r\n ','How did you become an Adobe Evangelist?','Someone on twitter asked how I became an Evangelist for Adobe.

I\'ll be taking on the role of IT Director for Wharton Research Data Services. WRDS (pronounced \"words\"), as we call it, is a suite of research applications that provide access to financial databases used around the business and business academic world.  We resell it to other educational organizations, making it a very important part of the Wharton brand.  I\'ll be taking over direction of the web portion of the application.\r\n</p><p>My first concern will be the giving the website a direly-needed facelift. To facilitate that we hired <a href=\"http://www.happycog.com/\">Happy Cog</a> to do a kick-ass redesign, that has been sitting unused for awhile.  I\'m going to get that new design up on the site, by October.  As part of that plan, I\'m going to be taking on automation and separation of content from design.   Of course, I won\'t be doing this alone. I\'ve got a new staff of which I\'m in charge\r\n</p><p>The technology that drives the site is Perl.  There are no thoughts on getting rid of all of the Perl, as it\'s needed to talk to the SAS databases on the backend.  I\'ll be adding ColdFusion where it makes sense - mostly in a community feature that we are building.  Additionally I\'m working on what amounts to a domain specific language (in ColdFusion) to automate page construction.  Thanks <a href=\"http://www.pbell.com/\">Peter Bell</a> for turning me on to that whole stuff.\r\n</p><p>It\'s sort of a bittersweet sort of thing.  It\'s the first move for me in awhile that involves complete change, as opposed to just increasing responsibilities. I give up all my safe ColdFusion cache.\r\n</p><p>The job of running our ColdFusion environment and providing ColdFusion leadership will be falling to <a href=\"http://www.lifelikeweeds.com/tech/\">Dave Konopka</a>.   I\'m extremely proud of him, since I hired him, and now he\'s replacing me.\r\n</p><p>While today is my official start date, I have permission to sort of coast through this week and start next Monday.

However, I\'m going to generalize the topics a bit. I\'m going to talk a bit about my experience as a client to Happy Cog (awesome in short.)

I made the comment that language performance can vary depending on what a particular language is best at doing. When you run into performance issues it can sometimes be helpful to try rewriting pieces of your app in a particular language for a performance boost.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I thought about how that could be done in App Engine. Let’s say I have a section of an application that I wrote in PHP, but it was getting more load than expected, so I need to boost its performance. I want to try and see if Go could give me the boost I need. How hard is that to do?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Please keep in mind all of the caveats here.  Sometimes you can get a boost, sometimes it\'s worth exploring. You know, it was a theoretical conversation. And for the record. This need to drop to another language doesn’t have to be performance related. It could be due to SDK or API restrictions, or developer knowledge, or just plain “I want to use another language to do this.\"</em></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In App Engine we do this through the use of <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/php/modules/\">modules</a>.  Modules allow us to separate front end and back end code from each other.  But they allow us to break up large applications into manageable chunks.  In this case, we\'re going to use them to allow us to break up code into multiple languages.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Let’s assume that you have an application with an app.yaml that looks like this:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre class=\"lang:yaml decode:true\" title=\"appphp.yaml\">application: &lt;appengine project name&gt;\r\nmodule: default\r\nversion: 1\r\napi_version: 1\r\nruntime: php55\r\nthreadsafe: yes\r\n\r\nhandlers:\r\n- url: /place\r\n  script: place.php  \r\n\r\n- url: /details\r\n  script: details.php   \r\n\r\n- url: /distance\r\n  script: distance.php</pre>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Let’s say that you want to swap out the distance method for go. The first thing you need to do is write a dispatch.yaml, which looks like this:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre class=\"lang:yaml decode:true\" title=\"dispatch.yaml Before\">application: &lt;appengine project name&gt;\r\n\r\ndispatch:\r\n- url: \"*/*\"\r\n  module: default</pre>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This will redirect all calls to your App Engine app to the Php application above. Which is what has been happening to date. But this is a setup step for later.  You then have to add the dispatch file to your application. In a command prompt, from the folder containing dispatch.yaml, run:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre class=\"theme:terminal lang:default decode:true\" title=\"Update Dispatch\">appcfg.py --oauth2  update_dispatch .</pre>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Write a replacement for your distance method in Go. Go on, we’ll wait…</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ok, assuming you’ve done that you write out an app.yaml for the Go code you wrote:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre class=\"lang:yaml decode:true\" title=\"appgo.yaml\">application:  &lt;appengine project name&gt;\r\nmodule: goapi\r\nversion: 1\r\nruntime: go\r\napi_version: go1\r\n\r\nhandlers:\r\n- url: /.*\r\n  script: _go_app</pre>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Take note of the module name. It has to be different from the original app’s module, which should be “default.”</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Once you have all of that handled you need to tweak your dispatch.yaml to replace calls made to the php version of the distance method to the Go method:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre class=\"lang:yaml decode:true\" title=\"dispatch.yaml After\">application:  &lt;appengine project name&gt;\r\n\r\ndispatch:\r\n- url: \"*/distance\"\r\n  module: goapi\r\n\r\n- url: \"*/*\"\r\n  module: default</pre>\r\nRerun the dispatch update:\r\n<pre class=\"theme:terminal lang:default decode:true\" title=\"Update dispatch again\">appcfg.py --oauth2  update_dispatch .</pre>\r\nAnd there you go, the original PHP service will answer all other calls, but the Go service will answer calls for /distance.\r\n\r\nRunning multiple language solutions in the same App Engine instance can solve some problems for you.  It also has a few interesting ramifications.  These include the ability to use the same shared Memcached instance between Go and Php. I\'m going to show that off in my next blog post.\r\n<blockquote>All code show here is licensed under Apache 2.

It has to be different from the original app’s module, which should be “default.”</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Once you have all of that handled you need to tweak your dispatch.yaml to replace calls made to the php version of the distance method to the Go method:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre class=\"lang:yaml decode:true\" title=\"dispatch.yaml After\">application:  &lt;appengine project name&gt;\r\n\r\ndispatch:\r\n- url: \"*/distance\"\r\n  module: goapi\r\n\r\n- url: \"*/*\"\r\n  module: default</pre>\r\nRerun the dispatch update:\r\n<pre class=\"theme:terminal lang:default decode:true\" title=\"Update dispatch again\">appcfg.py --oauth2  update_dispatch .</pre>\r\nAnd there you go, the original PHP service will answer all other calls, but the Go service will answer calls for /distance.\r\n\r\nRunning multiple language solutions in the same App Engine instance can solve some problems for you.  It also has a few interesting ramifications.  These include the ability to use the same shared Memcached instance between Go and Php. I\'m going to show that off in my next blog post.\r\n<blockquote>All code show here is licensed under Apache 2.

Let\'s not be a masochist and just do it in JSON - but I suppose it’s your choice.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Once you do that, it’s as simple as encoding to JSON in PHP:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre class=\"lang:php decode:true\" title=\"Json in PHP \">$memcache = new Memcache;\r\n\r\n$info[\'name\'] = \"hometown\";\r\n$info[\'city\'] = \"Philadelphia\";\r\n$info[\'state\'] = \"PA\";\r\n$info[\'latitude\'] = \"39.995664772727\"; \r\n$info[\'longitude\'] = \"-75.138788636364\";\r\n\r\n$secret = json_encode($info,JSON_NUMERIC_CHECK);\r\n\r\n$memcache-&gt;set(\"secret2\", $secret);\r\n$value = $memcache-&gt;get(\"secret2\");	\r\n\r\necho $value</pre>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Then decoding in Go.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre class=\"lang:go decode:true\">type Location struct {\r\n	Name  string  `json:\"name\"`\r\n	City  string  `json:\"city\"`\r\n	State string  `json:\"state\"`\r\n	Lat   float32 `json:\"latitude\"`\r\n	Lon   float32 `json:\"longitude\"`\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc jsonHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\r\n	c := appengine.NewContext(r)\r\n\r\n	var item Location\r\n	key := \"secret2\"\r\n	_, err := memcache.JSON.Get(c, key, &amp;item)\r\n	if err != nil {\r\n		handleError(w, err)\r\n	}\r\n\r\n	fmt.Fprintf(w, \"%+v\\n\", item)\r\n\r\n}</pre>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Note a couple of things:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>I omitted graceful memcache miss handling. I did so for brevity. Make sure you wrap your memcache code that handle cache misses.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you are not familiar with Go, those ‘json:’ comments aren’t just comments, they’re instructions on how to encode/decode data between Go and JSON.  So you need them, or it won’t work correctly.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n	<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I ran into an issue with the original version of this code because latitude and longitudes were coming out of the database into PHP as strings and not floats. When you went to get them out of memcache in Go, it would through a type mismatch error.  There are 2 solutions to this:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">cast them correctly to floats before you write to memcache</p>\r\n</li>\r\n	<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Use JSON_NUMERIC_CHECK in json_encode to get them to write as proper numerics when you write. This seems like the better solution</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Why do this?  For starters I was doing it so  both versions of my API could take advantage of caching done by the other language.  But I am sure there are other uses:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Communication between these modules</p>\r\n</li>\r\n	<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Offloading an expensive data retrieval and processing step to Go then reading memcache from PHP.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n	<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I’m curious if anyone reading has any thoughts.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Note: This will work on either type of memcache solution on App Engine: <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/adminconsole/memcache?hl=en_US\">shared or dedicated</a>. Just make sure you handle cache misses gracefully.</p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All code show here is licensed under Apache 2.

So, when do you use which tool?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The contenders:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/introduction\">Cloud SQL</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/concepts/overview\">Cloud Datastore</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/\">Cloud Bigtable</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Cloud SQL</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Are you using some sort of relational database with tables, views, and  indices? Does your application rely on stored procedures and custom table views or write joins? Do you need the certainty of transactions and ACID compliance?  Do you generally both read and write to the data, not in equal amounts, but not lopsidedly one or the other?  If you answered “yes” to a lot of these you probably want to investigate or stick with <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/introduction\">Cloud SQL</a>, which as its name suggests, is an implementation of MySQL hosted by Google.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cloud SQL does have all of the limitations of MySQL. Certain types of applications don’t require the complexity of normalized data with no duplication. Other cases require scaling in a manner that SQL cannot handle without additional complexity, reduced performance, or higher cost. Going into the full pros and cons of SQL vs NoSQL is beyond the scope of this post, but rest assured there are reasons that both of them exist, and both are valid choices depending on circumstances.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>NoSQL: Datastore or Bigtable</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you are leaning towards a NoSQL solution you now have two Google managed NoSQL choices on our platform. What is the differentiator between Cloud Datastore vs Cloud Bigtable? They are both NoSQL solutions. Both are described as massively scalable.  Both leave you with little to no management (or No Ops for those of you playing buzzword bingo).  The answer lies in four areas:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Size</li>\r\n	<li>Structure</li>\r\n	<li>Analysis</li>\r\n	<li>Interface</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Size</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Bigtable is optimized for mind boggling huge sets of data. Seriously, it is most cost effective when dealing with datasets that start at 1 Terabyte. Datastore can handle large data sets too, but Datastore is performance and cost optimized to handle smaller sets of data too.  Have a few GBs of data? Datastore would be the better call. Have data that might start out small, but grow to a Terabyte in time, still Datastore. Have data that starts at a Terabyte and will keep expanding? Then you’ve started down a path that might make Bigtable interesting. But size alone isn’t the only factor.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Structure</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Bigtable stores data in a big honkin’ table. Yeah, the name is a little on the nose, but it’s true. There are rows and columns somewhat like relational database systems but not exactly. But it has a schema, and predefined structure.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cloud Datastore, on the other hand, is more optimal for ad hoc storage of structured data representing objects.  Basically you define an object and then push it into Datastore. You don’t define a schema, create tables, or set up any other sort of structure before storing a record.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Analysis</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Do you need to analyze the data in massive aggregate scale while the database is still online and taking requests? Do you want to run MapReduce on your production data without copying it somewhere for study? Do you want to hook it up to various Big Data analysis toolkits?  If this sounds like what you want to do, Bigtable makes more sense.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Interface</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you are coming to Google Cloud Platform from other technologies, and are working with HBase, Bigtable is for you.  Bigtable is accessible through extensions to the HBase 1.0 API and is therefore compatible with a lot of the Hadoop ecosystem as well as other Big Data tools.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On the other hand,  there are also a few limitations. You cannot join. There is no SQL interface. The API gives you Put/Get/Delete individual records, or you can run Scan operations.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Datastore does not have SQL either, but has an API called GQL that while not exactly the same does abstract querying objects in a way that most SQL developers should be able to quickly understand.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Finally the <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/index\">product page</a> has a great explanation of Bigtable’s relation to other Google Cloud Platform offerings:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Cloud Bigtable and other storage options</h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cloud Bigtable is not a relational database; it does not support SQL queries or joins, nor does it support multi-row transactions. Also, it is not a good solution for small amounts of data (&lt; 1 TB).</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you need full SQL support for an online transaction processing (OLTP) system, consider <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/sql/\">Google Cloud SQL</a>.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n	<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you need interactive querying in an online analytical processing (OLAP) system, consider <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/\">Google BigQuery</a>.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n	<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you need to store immutable blobs larger than 10 MB, such as large images or movies, consider <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/storage/\">Google Cloud Storage</a>.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n	<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you need to store highly structured objects, or if you require support for ACID transactions and SQL-like queries, consider <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs\">Cloud Datastore</a>.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In short, there is a lot of awesome stuff about Cloud Bigtable, but it doesn’t mean that it is right in all cases.  It’s a NoOps, NoSQL, Big Data analysis tool, meant to be used at massive scale in conjunction with other Big Data tools.  I recommend that you check out the <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/index\">documentation for Bigtable</a> as there is much more to be found there.

Does your application rely on stored procedures and custom table views or write joins?

So, when do you use which tool?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The contenders:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/introduction\">Cloud SQL</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/concepts/overview\">Cloud Datastore</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/\">Cloud Bigtable</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Cloud SQL</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Are you using some sort of relational database with tables, views, and  indices? Does your application rely on stored procedures and custom table views or write joins? Do you need the certainty of transactions and ACID compliance?  Do you generally both read and write to the data, not in equal amounts, but not lopsidedly one or the other?  If you answered “yes” to a lot of these you probably want to investigate or stick with <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/introduction\">Cloud SQL</a>, which as its name suggests, is an implementation of MySQL hosted by Google.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cloud SQL does have all of the limitations of MySQL. Certain types of applications don’t require the complexity of normalized data with no duplication. Other cases require scaling in a manner that SQL cannot handle without additional complexity, reduced performance, or higher cost. Going into the full pros and cons of SQL vs NoSQL is beyond the scope of this post, but rest assured there are reasons that both of them exist, and both are valid choices depending on circumstances.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>NoSQL: Datastore or Bigtable</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you are leaning towards a NoSQL solution you now have two Google managed NoSQL choices on our platform. What is the differentiator between Cloud Datastore vs Cloud Bigtable? They are both NoSQL solutions. Both are described as massively scalable.  Both leave you with little to no management (or No Ops for those of you playing buzzword bingo).  The answer lies in four areas:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Size</li>\r\n	<li>Structure</li>\r\n	<li>Analysis</li>\r\n	<li>Interface</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Size</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Bigtable is optimized for mind boggling huge sets of data. Seriously, it is most cost effective when dealing with datasets that start at 1 Terabyte. Datastore can handle large data sets too, but Datastore is performance and cost optimized to handle smaller sets of data too.  Have a few GBs of data? Datastore would be the better call. Have data that might start out small, but grow to a Terabyte in time, still Datastore. Have data that starts at a Terabyte and will keep expanding? Then you’ve started down a path that might make Bigtable interesting. But size alone isn’t the only factor.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Structure</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Bigtable stores data in a big honkin’ table. Yeah, the name is a little on the nose, but it’s true. There are rows and columns somewhat like relational database systems but not exactly. But it has a schema, and predefined structure.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cloud Datastore, on the other hand, is more optimal for ad hoc storage of structured data representing objects.  Basically you define an object and then push it into Datastore. You don’t define a schema, create tables, or set up any other sort of structure before storing a record.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Analysis</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Do you need to analyze the data in massive aggregate scale while the database is still online and taking requests? Do you want to run MapReduce on your production data without copying it somewhere for study? Do you want to hook it up to various Big Data analysis toolkits?  If this sounds like what you want to do, Bigtable makes more sense.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Interface</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you are coming to Google Cloud Platform from other technologies, and are working with HBase, Bigtable is for you.  Bigtable is accessible through extensions to the HBase 1.0 API and is therefore compatible with a lot of the Hadoop ecosystem as well as other Big Data tools.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On the other hand,  there are also a few limitations. You cannot join. There is no SQL interface. The API gives you Put/Get/Delete individual records, or you can run Scan operations.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Datastore does not have SQL either, but has an API called GQL that while not exactly the same does abstract querying objects in a way that most SQL developers should be able to quickly understand.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Finally the <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/index\">product page</a> has a great explanation of Bigtable’s relation to other Google Cloud Platform offerings:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Cloud Bigtable and other storage options</h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cloud Bigtable is not a relational database; it does not support SQL queries or joins, nor does it support multi-row transactions. Also, it is not a good solution for small amounts of data (&lt; 1 TB).</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you need full SQL support for an online transaction processing (OLTP) system, consider <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/sql/\">Google Cloud SQL</a>.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n	<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you need interactive querying in an online analytical processing (OLAP) system, consider <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/\">Google BigQuery</a>.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n	<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you need to store immutable blobs larger than 10 MB, such as large images or movies, consider <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/storage/\">Google Cloud Storage</a>.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n	<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you need to store highly structured objects, or if you require support for ACID transactions and SQL-like queries, consider <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs\">Cloud Datastore</a>.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In short, there is a lot of awesome stuff about Cloud Bigtable, but it doesn’t mean that it is right in all cases.  It’s a NoOps, NoSQL, Big Data analysis tool, meant to be used at massive scale in conjunction with other Big Data tools.  I recommend that you check out the <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/index\">documentation for Bigtable</a> as there is much more to be found there. And let me know if you need more clarification on anything.</p>','When to Pick Google Bigtable vs Other Cloud Platform Databases','The addition of Google Cloud Bigtable is awesome, but potentially confusing.

We’d love for the Atlassian Community to host their add-ons with <a href=\"http://cloud.google.com/\">Google Cloud Platform</a>.  To help out, I’m releasing <a href=\"https://github.com/tpryan/Atlassian-Connect-Add-On-Starter-Kit-for-App-Engine\">Atlassian Connect Add On Starter Kit for App Engine on github</a>.</p>\r\n<a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/appengine/\">Google App Engine</a> is a great environment to get started hosting this sort of solution.\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>You just upload code.</li>\r\n	<li>We handle scaling for you.</li>\r\n	<li>App Engine serves up webservices with little to no config.</li>\r\n	<li>App Engine integrates well with other Google Developer Services</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOn the Atlassian side, as long as you write your services to respond the way Connect expects,  you can write your add-ons in whatever language or technology stack you want.\r\n\r\nI wrote the <a href=\"https://github.com/tpryan/Atlassian-Connect-Add-On-Starter-Kit-for-App-Engine\">Atlassian Connect Add On Starter Kit for App Engine</a> to give a working example for getting started on App Engine using each of the supported languages.  Each language folder (Go, Java, Php, Python) contains code to create two applications:\r\n\r\nHello World - basically the <a href=\"https://developer.atlassian.com/static/connect/docs/latest/guides/getting-started.html\">Hello World example written by Atlassian</a> with added App Engine configs to show the delta between a vanilla add-on and one configured to run on App Engine.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_816\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"974\"]<img class=\" wp-image-816  \" style=\"border: 1px solid #CCCCCC;\" alt=\"addon-world\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/rNg_zClDA_fwBQdrN7aMd3jGiZjaRQUNZUdk2b8daHu4TPK92egVTlbOFr3s4LivZJYtNaRvuQvTNFz-1AuuunP1UY_W1l0=s0\" width=\"974\" height=\"236\" /> The Hello World. Nothing special.[/caption]\r\n\r\nLanguage Check - this application scans a JIRA instance for issue titles in languages that differ from the default language, and then labels which language they are.  The idea is that you can then easily triage issues that should be routed to staff who can support that language.

I\'d like to try and start a conversation to see if we can fix that.  I feel like I am qualified to give advice here, as I spent my 20\'s as an angry and often offensive guy, who had to apologize quite a bit.  Because of this, I\'ve learned a little of what works and what doesn\'t.\r\n\r\nLet\'s start with a premise.  You said something that offended someone somewhere. They are angry, and they have called you out on it in some fashion.  (It\'s vague, but every example I could come up with might have been offensive.)\r\n\r\n<strong><em>\"Why should I apologize, what I said (or did) was right?\"</em></strong>\r\n\r\nThis here is the major problem we have with apologizing. We think that apologizing means that we are saying \"I was wrong, and you were right.\" It doesn\'t.  When you offend someone, you have damaged your relationship with them. Whether you are an individual offending another individual or a company who offended a potential market, your actions have damaged the relationship.  <strong>The true purpose of an apology is to try and fix the damage in the relationship between you and the offended party.</strong> That should be your goal.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>\"I didn\'t mean to offend you.\" </em></strong>\r\n\r\nActions have consequences, intentions do not matter.  Actually, it would be better to say, intentions can mitigate consequences, but they cannot erase them.  Suppose I hit a young man with my car. That my intention was to drive home has no impact on the consequence that the young man\'s leg is broken. Now the fact that I was soberly driving home, and did my best to swerve out of the way can maybe mitigate what the law says about my culpability, but it cannot fix the man\'s leg.\r\n\r\nSo, good on ya, that you didn\'t want to offend anyone. Unless you\'re a deliberate provocateur I don\'t assume anyone believes you did.  If you were deliberately offending people, I assume you don\'t have any interest in apologizing.  So if you are apologizing, shut up about your intentions. You just sound like you are trying to excuse yourself.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>\"I don\'t see what you are getting so upset about.\"</em></strong>\r\n\r\nThis is a shitty, defensive way of saying \"I don\'t understand how I offended you.\" That\'s fine.  It is perfectly acceptable to not understand how you have been offensive. If you were able to wrap your mind perfectly around the thoughts and considerations of the offended party, you probably wouldn\'t have taken the action that offended them. It\'s perfectly fine to ask for clarification and an explanation. Just try not to phrase that request like an asshole.\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\"I\'m having trouble wrapping my mind around this, can you explain where you\'re coming from?\" Good.</li>\r\n	<li>\"Can you tell me why a person like you is offended by this?\" - Bad.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong><em>\"I can\'t have said something homophobic, I have quite a few gay friends.\"</em></strong>\r\n\r\nRepeat after me: <strong>There is no such thing as a \"ghetto pass.\"</strong> That you have gay/female/minority friends does not mean you can\'t say homophobic/sexist/racist things.  It means that you probably shouldn\'t say them, and perhaps you should check to see if you still have those friends.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>\"You\'re overly sensitive.\"</em></strong>\r\n\r\nThis encapsulates a lot of things but at the core of it you are denying the reasonableness of the person taking offense.  The thought here being there are thoughts that while controversial, reasonable people can talk about without taking offense.  There are two problems with this.\r\n\r\nThe first problem with the reasonableness trope is that it assumes offense is an intellectual response.  It\'s not, it\'s an emotional response. Therefore reasonableness of the offense is irrelevant as offense in this case is not a product of the reason.  You can tell someone to stop being sad because their life is overall great, but if a personal tragedy has occurred, you can\'t stop them from being sad. Likewise whether or not it is reasonable to be offended is irrelevant in the face of actual offense.\r\n\r\nThe second problem with reasonableness is that it doesn\'t matter. Because reasonableness is part of the right/wrong discussion. \"It is not reasonable to be offended over this, therefore you are wrong and I am right.\"  --which is irrelevant, because apologies aren\'t about right and wrong, they\'re are about repairing the damage to the relationship.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>\"140 characters/email/IM is not enough to have a proper conversation about this.\"</em></strong>\r\n\r\nYou\'re right. Happy?  Now stop wasting time and move to a higher bandwidth form of communication.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>\"That\'s not what I meant.\"</em></strong>\r\n\r\nOkay, this is a tough one, and it\'s different from \"I didn\'t mean to be offensive.\"  It happens when what they think you said and what you think you said are two different things.  It could be because of someone mishearing you. It\'s also perfectly possible that someone is reading into what you have said or done, and giving it a context that makes it offensive to them. It\'s also possible that you were not communicating well.\r\n\r\nAgain it\'s time to remember what\'s important, fixing the damage.  So apologize first, get acceptance that you want to fix the damage, then start to talk about the misunderstanding.  Ask what language you could have use to make your intended meaning come through.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>So how should you apologize?</em></strong>\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Start with \"I am sorry I offended you.\" No qualifiers.  No \"If I offended anyone.\" You\'re sorry that the relationship is damaged and that you caused the damage.  Start from there.</li>\r\n	<li>Seek an understanding of what you did that caused offense, and acknowledge it.</li>\r\n	<li>No excuses. Unless you were kidnapped, drugged and slammed down in front of a keyboard or phone, you are responsible for whatever you did to offend someone.  Even if it is a \"not what I meant\" incident. You\'re responsible at least in part for the misunderstanding.</li>\r\n	<li>Don\'t apologize angry. When we are criticized, it\'s easy to get angry and emotional ourselves, and therefore get in the way of a real apology.  If the criticism you receive makes you angry or defensive, then wait and calm down.  Very little relationship damage can be fixed with anger.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nThere you have it, apology advice from someone who\'s had to do a lot of it. It\'s not about winning an argument, it\'s about saving a relationship.','We Suck at Apologies','','inherit','closed','closed','','500-revision-v1','','','2015-09-03 18:47:45','2015-09-03 18:47:45','',500,'http://terrenceryan.com/blog/index.php/500-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(846,1,'2015-11-12 16:26:23','2015-11-12 16:26:23','<p dir=\"ltr\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-732\" src=\"https://lh5.ggpht.com/mLlWVXgyM8mbSECli8BIu2aX6p4SDdZ6IW1E-gJFwqswmRFuuly32dGX3L_tCo52p288tUdHScmAgRLYYbG8YbMLm2hOn87k=s300\" alt=\"AppEngine_512px\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" />The other day I was talking to students at a bootcamp about languages. I made the comment that language performance can vary depending on what a particular language is best at doing. When you run into performance issues it can sometimes be helpful to try rewriting pieces of your app in a particular language for a performance boost.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I thought about how that could be done in App Engine. Let’s say I have a section of an application that I wrote in PHP, but it was getting more load than expected, so I need to boost its performance. I want to try and see if Go could give me the boost I need. How hard is that to do?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Please keep in mind all of the caveats here.  Sometimes you can get a boost, sometimes it\'s worth exploring. You know, it was a theoretical conversation. And for the record. This need to drop to another language doesn’t have to be performance related. It could be due to SDK or API restrictions, or developer knowledge, or just plain “I want to use another language to do this.\"</em></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In App Engine we do this through the use of <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/php/modules/\">modules</a>.  Modules allow us to separate front end and back end code from each other.  But they allow us to break up large applications into manageable chunks.  In this case, we\'re going to use them to allow us to break up code into multiple languages.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Let’s assume that you have an application with an app.yaml that looks like this:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre class=\"lang:yaml decode:true\" title=\"appphp.yaml\">application: &lt;appengine project name&gt;\r\nmodule: default\r\nversion: 1\r\napi_version: 1\r\nruntime: php55\r\nthreadsafe: yes\r\n\r\nhandlers:\r\n- url: /place\r\n  script: place.php  \r\n\r\n- url: /details\r\n  script: details.php   \r\n\r\n- url: /distance\r\n  script: distance.php</pre>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Let’s say that you want to swap out the distance method for go. The first thing you need to do is write a dispatch.yaml, which looks like this:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre class=\"lang:yaml decode:true\" title=\"dispatch.yaml Before\">application: &lt;appengine project name&gt;\r\n\r\ndispatch:\r\n- url: \"*/*\"\r\n  module: default</pre>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This will redirect all calls to your App Engine app to the Php application above. Which is what has been happening to date. But this is a setup step for later.  You then have to add the dispatch file to your application. In a command prompt, from the folder containing dispatch.yaml, run:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre class=\"theme:terminal lang:default decode:true\" title=\"Update Dispatch\">appcfg.py --oauth2  update_dispatch .</pre>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Write a replacement for your distance method in Go. Go on, we’ll wait…</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ok, assuming you’ve done that you write out an app.yaml for the Go code you wrote:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre class=\"lang:yaml decode:true\" title=\"appgo.yaml\">application:  &lt;appengine project name&gt;\r\nmodule: goapi\r\nversion: 1\r\nruntime: go\r\napi_version: go1\r\n\r\nhandlers:\r\n- url: /.*\r\n  script: _go_app</pre>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Take note of the module name. It has to be different from the original app’s module, which should be “default.”</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Once you have all of that handled you need to tweak your dispatch.yaml to replace calls made to the php version of the distance method to the Go method:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre class=\"lang:yaml decode:true\" title=\"dispatch.yaml After\">application:  &lt;appengine project name&gt;\r\n\r\ndispatch:\r\n- url: \"*/distance\"\r\n  module: goapi\r\n\r\n- url: \"*/*\"\r\n  module: default</pre>\r\nRerun the dispatch update:\r\n<pre class=\"theme:terminal lang:default decode:true\" title=\"Update dispatch again\">appcfg.py --oauth2  update_dispatch .</pre>\r\nAnd there you go, the original PHP service will answer all other calls, but the Go service will answer calls for /distance.\r\n\r\nRunning multiple language solutions in the same App Engine instance can solve some problems for you.  It also has a few interesting ramifications.  These include the ability to use the same shared Memcached instance between Go and Php. I\'m going to show that off in my next blog post.\r\n<blockquote>All code show here is licensed under Apache 2.

I haven’t had a chance to play it much, and wanted to fool around with it on PHP, but there is no documentation for PHP yet. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So here is a little primer on how to do this from PHP on App Engine.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First you have to do a few prerequisites:</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/free-trial/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sign up for Google Cloud Platform</span></a></li>\r\n	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/getting-started\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enable the Cloud Vision API and create a service account Cloud Vision API </span></a></li>\r\n	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/getting-started-console\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enable Cloud Storage  and Create a Bucket Cloud Storage</span></a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you do this you’re ready to start developing.

excited by the <a href=\"http://googlecloudplatform.blogspot.com/2016/02/Google-Cloud-Vision-API-enters-beta-open-to-all-to-try.html\">Cloud Vision API recently put into Beta</a> by Google Cloud Platform. I haven’t had a chance to play it much, and wanted to fool around with it from PHP on App Engine (or vanilla PHP for that matter), but there is no documentation for PHP yet. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So here is a little primer on how to do this from PHP on App Engine.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First you have to do a few prerequisites:</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/free-trial/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sign up for Google Cloud Platform</span></a></li>\r\n	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/getting-started\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enable the Cloud Vision API and create a service account Cloud Vision API </span></a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf you are going to do this on App Engine, you need to enable  Google Cloud Storage as well if not don\'t worry about this.\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/getting-started-console\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enable Cloud Storage  and Create a Bucket Cloud Storage</span></a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you do this you’re ready to start developing. Because I am running PHP on App Engine I used the </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/appengine/downloads#Google_App_Engine_SDK_for_PHP\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">App Engine SDK for PHP</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m going to use the GUI run this app, but you can use the command line just as easily.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-852 aligncenter\" src=\"http://terrenceryan.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cloud-vision-php-gaelauncher.png\" alt=\"cloud-vision-php-gaelauncher\" width=\"825\" height=\"750\" />\r\n\r\nIf you are doing this off App Engine, run PHP how ever you want.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first thing I need to do is write a <strong>php.ini</strong> that properly <a href=\"http://terrenceryan.com/blog/index.php/php-on-app-engine-does-curl/\">allows cURL</a> and has a good limit on uploaded files.</span>\r\n<pre class=\"lang:ini decode:true\" title=\"php.ini \">google_app_engine.enable_curl_lite = 1\r\nupload_max_filesize = 5M</pre>\r\nIf I\'m not using App Engine, you may have to do different things to enable cURL.  But keep the file limit.\r\n<pre class=\"lang:default decode:true\" title=\"Alternate php.ini\">upload_max_filesize = 5M</pre>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then I setup a page named <strong>creds.php</strong> to hold my API key for Cloud Storage and my Cloud Storage Bucket name.</span>\r\n<pre class=\"lang:php decode:true\" title=\"creds.php\">&lt;?php \r\n//Create Bucket here \r\n// https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/getting-started-console#create_a_bucket\r\n$bucket = \"YOUR BUCKET HERE\";\r\n// Get Service account API hereL \r\n// https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/getting-started#setting_up_a_service_account\r\n$api_key = \"YOUR API KEY HERE \";\r\n\r\n ?&gt;</pre>\r\nAgain, you can skip Cloud Storage Code, if you aren\'t using App Engine.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then I create a form page named <strong>index.php</strong> that creates an <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/php/googlestorage/user_upload\">App Engine Upload URL</a> for me. The the form posts to that Upload URL.</span>\r\n<pre class=\"lang:php decode:true\" title=\"index.php\">&lt;?php\r\ninclude_once(\"creds.php\"); // Get $bucket\r\nuse google\\appengine\\api\\cloud_storage\\CloudStorageTools;\r\n\r\n$options = [ \'gs_bucket_name\' =&gt; $bucket ];\r\n$upload_url = CloudStorageTools::createUploadUrl(\'/process.php\', $options);\r\n\r\n?&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\r\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\r\n&lt;head&gt;\r\n	&lt;meta charset=\"UTF-8\"&gt;\r\n	&lt;title&gt;Cloud Vision API PHP Example&lt;/title&gt;\r\n&lt;/head&gt;\r\n&lt;body&gt;\r\n	&lt;form action=\"&lt;?php echo $upload_url ?&gt;\" method=\"post\" enctype=\"multipart/form-data\"&gt;\r\n	Your Photo: &lt;input type=\"file\" name=\"photo\" size=\"25\" /&gt;\r\n	&lt;input type=\"submit\" name=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\" /&gt;\r\n&lt;/form&gt;\r\n&lt;/body&gt;\r\n&lt;/html&gt;</pre>\r\nIf I wanted to not use App Engine and instead use PHP on a VM or container, I could just skip the call to Cloud Storage Tools and post directly to the next file in the example: <strong>process.php</strong>. App Engine is the part that requires this, not the Cloud Vision API.\r\n<pre class=\"lang:default decode:true \" title=\"alternate index.php\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\r\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\r\n&lt;head&gt;\r\n	&lt;meta charset=\"UTF-8\"&gt;\r\n	&lt;title&gt;Cloud Vision API PHP Example&lt;/title&gt;\r\n&lt;/head&gt;\r\n&lt;body&gt;\r\n	&lt;form action=\"process.php\" method=\"post\" enctype=\"multipart/form-data\"&gt;\r\n	Your Photo: &lt;input type=\"file\" name=\"photo\" size=\"25\" /&gt;\r\n	&lt;input type=\"submit\" name=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\" /&gt;\r\n&lt;/form&gt;\r\n&lt;/body&gt;\r\n&lt;/html&gt;</pre>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then <strong>process.php</strong> does the hard work of taking the uploaded file, converting it to base64 and uploading to the Cloud Vision API. </span>\r\n<pre class=\"lang:php decode:true\" title=\"process.php\">&lt;?php\r\n\r\ninclude_once(\"creds.php\"); // Get $api_key\r\n$cvurl = \"https://vision.googleapis.com/v1/images:annotate?key=\" . $api_key;\r\n$type = \"LANDMARK_DETECTION\";\r\n\r\n//Did they upload a file...\r\nif($_FILES[\'photo\'][\'name\'])\r\n{\r\n	//if no errors...\r\n	if(!$_FILES[\'photo\'][\'error\'])\r\n	{\r\n		$valid_file = true;\r\n		//can\'t be larger than ~4 MB\r\n		if($_FILES[\'photo\'][\'size\'] &gt; (4024000)) \r\n		{\r\n			$valid_file = false;\r\n			die(\'Your file\\\'s size is too large.\');\r\n		}\r\n\r\n		//if the file has passed the test\r\n		if($valid_file)\r\n		{\r\n			//convert it to base64\r\n			$fname = $_FILES[\'photo\'][\'tmp_name\'];\r\n			$data = file_get_contents($fname);\r\n			$base64 = base64_encode($data);\r\n			//Create this JSON\r\n			$r_json =\'{\r\n			  	\"requests\": [\r\n					{\r\n					  \"image\": {\r\n					    \"content\":\"\' . $base64. \'\"\r\n					  },\r\n					  \"features\": [\r\n					      {\r\n					      	\"type\": \"\' .$type. \'\",\r\n							\"maxResults\": 200\r\n					      }\r\n					  ]\r\n					}\r\n				]\r\n			}\';\r\n\r\n			$curl = curl_init();\r\n			curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_URL, $cvurl);\r\n			curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);\r\n			curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER,\r\n				array(\"Content-type: application/json\"));\r\n			curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_POST, true);\r\n			curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $r_json);\r\n			$json_response = curl_exec($curl);\r\n			$status = curl_getinfo($curl, CURLINFO_HTTP_CODE);\r\n			curl_close($curl);\r\n\r\n			if ( $status != 200 ) {\r\n			    die(\"Error: $cvurl failed status $status\" );\r\n			}\r\n\r\n			echo \"&lt;pre&gt;\";\r\n			echo $json_response;\r\n			echo \"&lt;/pre&gt;\";\r\n		}\r\n	}\r\n	//if there is an error...\r\n	else\r\n	{\r\n		//set that to be the returned message\r\n		echo \"Error\";\r\n		 die(\'Drror:  \'.$_FILES[\'photo\'][\'error\']);\r\n	}\r\n}\r\n?&gt;\r\n</pre>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally I have to create an <strong>app.yaml</strong> to serve up the two pages.

I haven’t had a chance to play with it much, and I wanted to fool around with it from PHP on App Engine (or vanilla PHP for that matter), but there is no documentation for PHP yet. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So here is a little primer on how to do this from PHP on App Engine.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First you have to complete a few prerequisites:</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/free-trial/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sign up for Google Cloud Platform</span></a></li>\r\n	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/getting-started\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enable the Cloud Vision API and create a service account </span></a></li>\r\n	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/getting-started-console\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enable Cloud Storage  and create a bucket</span></a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you do this you’re ready to start developing.

Root disks seem to need a reboot to make this work - and automatically rebooting seems like a bad idea. So if you run it on a root disk it will work, but the extra space won’t be available until you manually reboot the machine.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be careful with quotas. My solution here has a default max disk size of 64TB because that is the max disk that GCE disks can be. You may want to be more conservative with your limits because disk size = money. Also you have a </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/resource-quotas\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">quota</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on your account for the amount of SSD you can assign.  As of this writing it is 2TB.  You can always raise it, but this script cannot get around your quota, and will fail if it tries to. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All that out of the way, let’s give this a shot. </span>\r\n\r\n<b>Step 1 - Script it</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first step is to put together a script that:</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Checks the utilization of a disk.</span></li>\r\n 	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the utilization is too high, resizes the disk in Google Cloud Platform</span></li>\r\n 	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then also resizes the disk on the host OS.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a couple of other things we want to configure in this script:</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is the threshold percent that is high enough to resize the disk? </span></li>\r\n 	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is the factor by that we’ll increase the disk? Double it? Triple it?</span></li>\r\n 	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is the maximum limit to which we will increase the disk? </span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keeping all of that in mind, here is my solution in Bash for Debian (our default OS choice on Compute Engine.)

It’s pretty straightforward:</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make a Secrets file, remembering to base64 encode your secrets.</span>\r\n<pre class=\"lang:yaml decode:true \" title=\"Secrets file\">apiVersion: v1\r\nkind: Secret\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: wordpress-secrets\r\ntype: Opaque\r\ndata:\r\n  username: d293IHlvdSBkZWNvZGVkIGl0  \r\n  password: Z29vZCBmb3IgeW91\r\n  host: bm90aGluZyBqdWljeSB0aG91Z2g=</pre>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then configure your pod definition to use the secrets. </span>\r\n<pre class=\"lang:yaml decode:true \" title=\"Deployment file\">apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1\r\nkind: Deployment\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: wordpress-deployment\r\nspec:\r\n  replicas: 2\r\n  strategy:\r\n      type: RollingUpdate\r\n  template:\r\n    metadata:\r\n      labels:\r\n        app: wordpress\r\n        visualize: \"true\"\r\n    spec:\r\n      containers:\r\n      - name: \"wordpress\"\r\n        image: \"wordpress\"\r\n        ports:\r\n        - containerPort: 80\r\n        env:\r\n        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_USER\r\n          valueFrom:\r\n            secretKeyRef:\r\n              name: wordpress-secrets\r\n              key: username\r\n        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD\r\n          valueFrom:\r\n            secretKeyRef:\r\n              name: wordpress-secrets\r\n              key: password\r\n        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST\r\n          valueFrom:\r\n            secretKeyRef:\r\n              name: wordpress-secrets\r\n              key: host</pre>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s it. It’s a great addition to the secrets API.  I’m trying to track down when it was added. It looks like it came in 1.2.  The first reference I could find to it in the docs was in this </span><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes.github.io/commit/f16668b45f5a8ca4d734f0356c72d63451e8a6bb\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">commit</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  updating Kubernetes Documentation for 1.2. </span>','Kubernetes Secrets Directly to Environment Variables','Using Secret files to populate environmental variables in Kubernetes.
